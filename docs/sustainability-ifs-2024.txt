As we present the 2024 IFS
Sustainability Report, I am proud to
reflect on three years of dedicated
reporting and transparency.

This year has been exceptional,
with significant achievements
that underscore our unwavering
commitment to sustainability.”

This year has been exceptional,
with significant achievements
that underscore our unwavering
commitment to sustainability.

We maintained best-in-class
participation rates for our
Pulse survey, achieving a
global participation rate of
93% with a total of 18,300
comments. Our diversity
& inclusion commitments
have been furthered through
multiple initiatives, including
the Neurodiversity Employee
Resource Group.

We have reached multiple
sustainability targets ahead
of schedule. Our collaboration
with 156 educational institutions
and the increase in female
managers to 33% are
testaments to our ongoing
efforts. Additionally, 25% of our
employees volunteered in 2024,
surpassing our target of 20%
and achieving a fivefold growth
since 2021.
Our dedication to expanding
our CSRD alignment has been
steadfast. We conducted
a robust double materiality
assessment and closed more
than 70% of our gaps in
2024. By adopting the latest
best practice principles of
double materiality, we have
comprehensively evaluated key
sustainability issues significant
to both IFS operations and our
stakeholders.

In collaboration with PwC
UK*, we developed a CSRDcompliant system as part of
our Sustainability Management
Module.
By combining PwC's regulatory
expertise with IFS’s technical
capabilities, we successfully
automated 18 key performance
indicators in 2024, including
metrics like employee turnover
rate, total full-time employees,
and gender statistics.
As we look ahead, we remain
committed to our new 2029
Vision, which emphasizes
building a high-performing
team and leveraging Industrial
AI to drive our sustainability
initiatives.

Our approach is twofold:
integrating sustainability into
our internal operations while
aspiring to lead in the industry.
We will continue to strengthen
our network of Sustainability
Business Partners (SBPs),
ensuring that our efforts are
collaborative and impactful.
By leveraging AI and
sustainability, we aim to
establish a unique position in
the market, working closely with
our customers to validate and
enhance this approach. Our
commitment to sustainability
is deeply aligned with IFS core
values, and we will continue
to embed these principles
into every aspect of our
business. Together, we can
achieve a more sustainable
future, driving positive change
for our community and the
environment.

CSO Letter
I firmly believe in the technology
sector’s ability to drive
transformational change
across various industries,
offering the ‘how’ roadmap for
the transition to a low-carbon,

Industrial AI is a critical part of
that story, and IFS is already
helping our customers to do
more with less, transform to new
ways of working, and manage
their sustainability performance
transparently.
I am proud that this year we
have continued to build on our
robust sustainability strategy
to drive meaningful results.
Through collaboration with our
team, customers and partners,
we will continue to drive a lasting
positive impact.

practices form
the cornerstone
of IFS operations.
I’m proud to say that we are
dedicated to maintaining
the highest standards of
integrity and transparency
by reinforcing the role of
the Board in overseeing our
sustainability strategy. By
embedding ESG principles
into our core processes, we
ensure that our business

meaningful value.˝

Jacqueline de Rojas
Board Level Sustainability
Representative

Since joining IFS
in 2024, I have
been impressed
by how closely
sustainability is
integrated into
the company’s
overall culture.
It is clearly seen that IFS is
dedicated to fostering an
environment where every
employee feels recognized
and valued for their unique
differences. High employee
engagement is also viewed
as a key part of actively
participating in internal
sustainability initiatives,
such as CSR Day and Get

that in 2024, 25.46% of
employees volunteered,
beating our target of 20%
ahead of our initial schedule.˝

Debra McCowan
Chief HR Officer

Our commitment
to sustainability
is central to our
long-term success
and financial
resilience.
By integrating ESG principles
into our core strategies
and financial decisionmaking processes, we foster
sustainable growth and
create lasting value for our
stakeholders. Our focus
on responsible practices
ensures that we allocate
resources effectively,
manage risks prudently, and
seize opportunities that align
with our values.
It is clear that sustainability
reporting now holds
the same importance
as financial reporting,
helping us navigate today’s
challenges and capitalize on
tomorrow’s opportunities.

Sustainability Business Partners
Launched in 2023, the Sustainability Business
Partners (SBP) network has grown significantly this
year, welcoming new members and expanding its
influence across the organization. The network
bridges the gap between sustainability strategy
and day-to-day operations, ensuring sustainable
principles are integral to business decisionmaking and practices.
Members develop expertise specific to their
work areas, enhancing their ability to address
sustainability challenges in an industry-specific
context. This targeted approach connects the
general sustainability framework to the unique
needs of their functions, driving tangible action.
Cross-functional working groups are a key part
of our approach, bringing together expertise
from across the business to tackle specific
sustainability challenges. We have established
groups focused on CSRD compliance, EU
taxonomy, and decarbonization, among others,
and continue to expand these efforts in response
to emerging needs.

These groups serve as platforms for
collaboration, knowledge sharing, and
developing concrete solutions that integrate
sustainability into core business activities.
In 2024, IFS introduced its Sustainability
Academy, which serves as an internal training
program where members can deepen their
understanding of industry-relevant sustainability
aspects. The academy offers tailored learning
experiences that address the most pressing
challenges faced by the organization. In
addition to internal development, we provide
access to external training programs,
ensuring our members stay at the forefront of
sustainability knowledge and best practices.
As part of our strategy, we aim to integrate
our mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activities
across all areas, including the SBPs network.
In 2024, IFS Ultimo established a dedicated
Sustainability Business Partner within the IFS SBP
network, helping to embed a unified approach
to sustainability across the IFS Group.
Through these initiatives, the Sustainability
Business Partner Network plays a vital role in
translating sustainability strategy into action,
ensuring that sustainability is not just a goal
but a fundamental part of how we operate.

Serving as a
Sustainability
Business Partner
is an enriching
journey that goes
beyond regulatory
compliance.
It has provided a unique
opportunity to integrate
sustainability into our risk
management framework,
drive meaningful change
and balance between
economic, social and
environmental facets. The
training received through
the Sustainability Academy
has been instrumental in
expanding my knowledge
and understanding on
regulatory framework and
best ESG practices and
helped me in driving the
sustainability culture in the
organization and personally.”

In 2023, the SBTi approved
IFS’ near-term (2030)

our submission earlier in
the year.

In 2024, IFS completed its acquisition of
Copperleaf, a leading provider of AI-powered
Enterprise Asset Investment Planning and
Management (AIPM) software. This acquisition
allows us to thread sustainability through the
asset lifecycle, as it integrates environmental
and social criteria into investment planning
decisions through decision analytics.

In 2024, IFS also acquired EmpowerMX, a
leading provider of AI-powered aviation
maintenance software. This technology
enables smarter, more efficient maintenance,
repair, and overhaul (MRO) operations. By
combining IFS industrial AI with EmpowerX's
capabilities, aviation customers benefit from
deep industry-specific AI capabilities. In
the face of challenges such as unexpected
downtime, supply chain disruption, labor
and skill shortages, this offering enhances
resilience, efficiency and safety in airline
operations.

Material Sustainability Topics

This year, we continued our efforts to strengthen
our CSRD alignment by establishing a new,
robust double materiality assessment, initiating
our internal work on EU Taxonomy and working
closely with internal stakeholders on the
gap analysis and action plan. As a result of
our consistent involvement in each of these

prioritized areas, we managed to close more
than 70% of our CSRD gaps by the year end of
2024. However, we recognize that there is still
more to be done, and we are working closely
with the business to fully align with CSRD
requirements.

Double Materiality
We understand that a thorough materiality
assessment is the foundation of an effective
sustainability strategy. It guides our approach
to strategy, risk and opportunity assessment,
disclosure structure, and preparation for
regulatory frameworks, such as the CSRD.

In 2024, we adopted the latest best practice
principles of double materiality, conducting a
comprehensive evaluation of key sustainability
issues that are significant both to IFS operations
and our stakeholders. For this, we partnered
with Datamaran, an ESG risk identification
and monitoring software company that uses a
comprehensive data-driven process to identify,
prioritize and monitor sustainability issues.
Its business intelligence tool aims to leverage
artificial intelligence to incorporate a wide array
of inputs, including corporate reports, global
regulations, social media and online news.

Using Datamaran’s help, we produced a
materiality assessment driven by both our
in-house ESG perspective, internal stakeholder
priorities and AI based technology. This type
of assessment involved a robust examination
of our business activities, as well as those
occurring within IFS value chain—both upstream
and downstream.
As part of the assessment, we identified 11
material topics that were further used for
Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities (IRO)
mapping. These were ranked below.

Material Sustainability Topics
continued
During 2025, we will incorporate this analysis
into IFS' refreshed sustainability strategy,
governance and targets, to reflect the focus
areas most relevant to our business. We will
use dynamic assessments for ongoing “pulse”
analyses, which help identify shifts in the
macro environment and emerging IROs. These
insights are also integrated into our enterprise
risk management, resource planning and
sustainability reporting, ensuring management
of relevant topics and alignment with regulatory
standards.

Identified Material Topics

EU Taxonomy
EU taxonomy is a classification system
established by the European Union to provide
a common unified framework to determine
whether an economic activity is environmentally
sustainable. The taxonomy defines two main
categories, taxonomy-eligible activities,
which fall within the sectors covered by the EU
Taxonomy, and taxonomy-aligned activities,
which meet the specific screening criteria
for environmental sustainability set out in the
framework.

As part of a joint effort between the
Sustainability and Finance teams, and with
the support of PwC, these activities have
been identified and are included in the scope
of assurance, ensuring the accuracy and
credibility of our reporting.
Looking ahead, we plan to take further steps
in 2025 to ensure we are fully prepared for the
reporting requirements and in alignment with
regulatory expectations. To achieve this, we
will focus on the following priorities:

Its main purpose is to direct investment towards
economic activities that contribute to key
environmental objectives, such as climate
change mitigation and adaptation.
It also focuses on enhancing transparency for
investors and stakeholders by preventing green
washing and mitigating market fragmentation.

Comprehensive Data Collection
We will gather all necessary data for the
identified eligible activities, ensuring
completeness and accuracy to support the
assessment process. This includes refining
internal processes for tracking sustainabilityrelated performance metrics.

In 2024, we began our internal work on the EU
Taxonomy as part of our CSRD reporting efforts,
with a key focus on identifying eligible activities
within IFS.

Assessment Against Technical
Screening Criteria
Each eligible activity will be evaluated against
the EU Taxonomy’s technical screening criteria
to determine whether it meets the substantial
contribution requirements for environmental
objectives.
Evaluation of Do No Significant Harm (DNSH)
and Minimum Safeguards
We will conduct a thorough review to confirm
that all eligible activities comply with the
“Do No Significant Harm” principle and meet
the EU’s minimum social and governance
safeguards.
Development of a Sustainability
EU Taxonomy Policy

Introduction

Our approach

Climate-Related
Disclosures
Background to the ISSB
In July 2023, the International Sustainability
Standards Board (ISSB) issued its inaugural
IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards—IFRS
S1 (General Requirements for Disclosure of
Sustainability-related Financial Information)
and IFRS S2 (Climate-related Disclosures).
This marked a shift in the global landscape
for climate-related risk disclosures, with the
Financial Stability Board (FSB) transferring
responsibility for monitoring climate-related
disclosures to the IFRS Foundation. The ISSB
sits underneath the IFRS alongside its sister
organization, the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB). IFRS actively promotes
connectivity between IASB and ISSB standards.
The IFRS S1 and S1 standards are the next
evolution of the widely accepted Taskforce on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
recommendations, previously issued by the FSB.

Our business

Area

Whilst the new standards contain some
differences, the core objectives remain the
same as the TCFD’s – to raise sustainability
disclosures to the level of financial disclosures
– thereby improving businesses’ ability to
assess and act on non-financial risks and
opportunities, and to enable investors to obtain
a holistic view of business performance and
strategies for sustainability-related topics.
According to IFRS, the momentum behind the
new standards is growing – as of September
2024, 30 jurisdictions have either adopted or are
taking steps to introduce ISSB Standards in their
legal or regulatory frameworks. Together, these
jurisdictions represent:

	
More than 40% of global market

capitalization; and

	
More than half of global greenhouse

gas (GHG) emissions.

How IFS is aligning with ISSB Standards
In 2023, IFS reported in alignment with the
TCFD recommendations. Since the publishing
of the new ISSB standards, we have adapted our
climate-related disclosures to align with the ISSB
Standards and ensure we are following the latest
best practice. In 2024, our first year of reporting
under ISSB, we apply transition relief (IFRS S1
paragraph E5), meaning we focus on climaterelated disclosures only.

International
Sustainability
Standards Board
(ISSB)

Looking ahead to 2025, we will broaden our
sustainability disclosures to increase our
alignment with the requirements of IFRS S1 and
S2 in parallel with our work on CSRD alignment.
The ESRS has a high degree of interoperability
with both ISSB standards so these workstreams
are complimentary.

2024 Targets

Governance

IFRS S2 mirrors the TCFD’s recommendations
with a small number of additions whilst the
IFRS S1 standard goes beyond just climate to
encompass broader sustainability-related
disclosures.

The Road Ahead
In 2025, we will continue to build on the progress
made in 2024 by expanding and strengthening
our initiatives across governance, strategy, risk
management, and metrics & targets.
While climate-related goals remain a key focus,
we plan to broaden our approach to encompass
overall sustainability and our efforts will include
upskilling leadership, embedding sustainability
into decision-making, and strengthening risk
assessments and reporting.
Governance
Sustainability topics including climate strategy,
metrics and targets are managed under the IFS
Sustainability Governance framework.
In 2024, climate-related risk and opportunity
management was fully integrated into our
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework,
aligning this with our broader risk management
processes and ensuring sustainability topics
are considered as part of daily operational and
strategic planning. The ERM is governed by the
IFS Global Risk function who continue to work
closely with the IF Global Sustainability Team on
sustainability-related topics.
For more information on the IFS Sustainability
Governance model please refer to page 8 of our
“Our Approach” section. For more information
on the IFS ERM please refer to the Risk
Management section below.
Strategy
In 2024, IFS continued to assess our key climaterelated risks and opportunities, following on
from work conducted in 2023 with the IFS
Sustainability Business Partner (SBP) community
and PwC, to identify, benchmark, and evaluate
the potential impacts and of these topics on our
business over a number of climate scenarios.

Climate Resilience Analysis
In 2023, IFS engaged with PwC to conduct
qualitative climate scenario analysis focused
on our most important climate-related risks and
opportunities. You can read more about this
analysis in our 2023 Sustainability Report.
In 2024, we continued to monitor and manage
key climate-related risks and opportunities, and
in addition, conducted quantitative analysis on
our global offices. These sites were assessed
against 11 physical climate hazards and three
different climate scenarios using Spectra, a
proprietary digital platform developed by
market-leading climate risk specialists,
Climate X.
Strategic Planning
This year, we used Spectra to evaluate the
anticipated climate risk profiles of our existing
office portfolio. This allowed us to identify
offices with higher risk profiles and determine
the appropriate actions to mitigate or adapt
to potential climate impacts.
In future, we plan to further integrate physical
climate risk analysis into our strategic real
estate assessment and decisions, including
during potential lease renewals and office
relocations.

*	The following climate risks and opportunities were identified as material in the 2024 Impact Risk and Opportunities exercise and were assessed against the materiality threshold defined by the CSRD.
The threshold was benchmarked at a risk/opportunity level value classified as “Critical” or “Severe” (from five categories: Controlled, Serious, Disruptive, Severe, or Critical.)
** IFS has defined time horizons for the classification of risks and strategic opportunities as per our Enterprise Risk Management framework: Short Term: 1-3 Years, Medium Term: 3-10 Years, Long Term: 10+ Years.

Spectra Hazard Ratings
For a quick and easy interpretation of risk,
each hazard is assigned a rating. These ratings
consider the potential physical and financial
impact that would be associated with the
severity of a climate-related event, combined
with the likelihood of that event happening.
As different types of events will have different
levels of impact, each hazard type has its own
rating definition. For all hazards the risk ratings
go from A to F, with A representing the lowest
risk and F representing the highest risk.
Portfolio Analysis Results
The analysis described is based on the SSP5-8.5
climate scenario which represents a highemission, fossil-fuelled development scenario.
Using this scenario enables conservative risk
management and planning.

Considering the 2020 to 2030 timeframe, the
proportion of offices exposed to high-impact
risk (rating E-F) in 2030 remained relatively
low at 0% for 6 hazards and 4-19% for 5
hazards. The analysis showed surface flooding,
subsidence and extreme heat increasing in risk
profile, with the share of offices increasing from
0-4% up to 10-12% for these hazards. All other
hazards demonstrated flat or decreasing risk
profiles for high-impact risk (E-F rating).

Scenario Selection
To ensure consistency with our 2023
scenario analysis, we selected the below
Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). As
mentioned above, we primarily use SSP5-8.5 for
conservative risk management and planning, as
well as 2030- and 2050-time horizons.

When considering the longer-term picture, the
proportion of offices exposed to high-impact
risk (rating E-F) remains relatively low to 2045
at ~10% when considering aggregated scores
across hazards and assets. There is however a
clear uptick in potential exposure after 2045
with ~15% of offices facing high-impact risk by
2100.

Risk Management
Enterprise Risk Management Framework
IFS employs a structured Enterprise Risk
Management Framework to systematically
identify, assess, and mitigate risks that impact
the organization.
At its core is the enterprise risk register, a
centralized repository for all material risks at
the Group level. Risks and opportunities are
identified, evaluated, and managed by local
management teams in each region or business
unit. They are responsible for recognizing and
assessing risks and opportunities specific
to their operations, ensuring that proactive
mitigation strategies are in place. Each plan
is assigned an owner, with mitigation actions
tracked against defined timelines to maintain
accountability and ensure progress. The risk
register is updated at least annually to reflect
changes in the company’s structure, operations,
and material risk landscape.

Metrics & Targets

For more details on SBTi commitment, please
refer to the "Environmental Impact" section,
page 18.

External risks are also identified and assessed
to establish the impact to the business,
and material risks are escalated to the
local management teams and Executive
Management for deliberation and necessary
action.
The IFS Global Risk Management Function
oversees the annual risk assessment, ensuring
adherence to the established Enterprise Risk
Management Policy. Material business risks and
incidents are reported to the Chief Financial
Officer (CFO), who evaluates them against
mitigation strategies and action plans to assess
their effectiveness in reducing residual risk
levels.
A comprehensive risk overview is then presented
to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Audit
Committee, and Board of Directors for informed
decision-making.
By integrating risk management into its strategic
planning, IFS maintains alignment with business
objectives while ensuring accountability,
adaptability, and resilience.

In 2023, IFS conducted a climate risk and
opportunity analysis workstream (see 2023
Sustainability Report). This was delivered in
parallel to our enterprise risk management
process. In 2024, we successfully integrated
the two processes, with climate-related
risk and opportunity management now
fully integrated into our Enterprise Risk
Management (ERM) framework.

As part of this process, the risks and
opportunities previously identified were
integrated into risk registers at functional
level. This change enhances awareness of
sustainability risks across business functions
and delivers a more collaborative approach
to managing risk across the organization.
By embedding sustainability into risk
management, IFS strengthens its ability to
anticipate, mitigate, and adapt to evolving
sustainability challenges.

2024 Carbon Performance
Our overall footprint increased in 2024 by 19%
with respect to 2023, with the majority of the
change coming from Scope 3. A major driver
of the increases were several changes to our
methodology, including reporting on additional
emissions sources and utilizing more up-todate emissions factors. These changes due to
methodology will be factored out when we recalculate our baseline year data, an exercise
we plan to complete in 2025.
Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions remained broadly
flat with respect to the emissions sources
that were reported in 2023, with both Mobile
Combustion and Fugitive Emissions reported for
the first time this year due to availability of new
information.
Within Scope 3, Purchased Goods & Services
(PGS) and Business Travel (BT) accounted for
the majority of the increase. PGS changes are
attributable to improvements in data accuracy
rather than changes to real-world emissions
whereas the changes in BT are a combination
of increased travel activity and more accurate
emissions factors.
Key Changes in 2024
Every year we seek ways to improve the
accuracy and completeness of our GHG
data in line with GHG Protocol and SBTi
recommendations. In 2024 we expanded and
improved quality of our data through improved
data collection and calculation tools via IFS
Cloud Emissions Management.
Data collection improvements – we decreased
the share of estimated emissions data
Integration of acquisitions – all acquisitions
that were completed in 2024 were factored
into our reporting
 ethodology improvements – we migrated
M
to IFS Cloud Emissions Management and
used its granular emissions factor selection to
increase precision and accuracy of our carbon
calculations

Emission Factor Selection

Renewable Electricity*
As part of IFS’ continued commitment to
source 100% renewable energy across
our operations, we once again matched
100% of our non-renewable grid electricity

*Renewable electricity (RE) is generated from renewable resources,
which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such
as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. IFS
purchases Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) to cover its grid
electricity consumption across global facilities that are under its
operational control. 1 EAC represents 1 MWh of verified 100% RE
generated by a provider. Green tariffs refer to contracts for 100%
RE that usually consist of bundled EACs. Purchasing EACs therefore
enables IFS to decarbonize its electricity supply. For more details,
please refer to our "KPI Definitions" section of Annex, page 44.

Green Facilities Strategy
At IFS, the process for selection of new premises
includes sustainability and energy performance
criteria. Key factors considered include EPC
ratings, as well as other globally recognized
building certifications like LEED and BREEAM.

IFS partnered with market-leading emissions
factor (EF) provider, Climatiq, to obtain the latest
and most accurate EFs via an integration with
IFS Cloud Emissions Management for Scope 1
and 2 emissions (see 'Our customers' section
for more information). EFs were selected on the
basis of specificity to the activity in question
(e.g. generation of grid electricity), geographical
location (e.g. Paris, France v.s. European
average), and recency (as close to the reporting
year as possible).
For Scope 3, a combination of activity and
spend-based calculations were used with the
support of Schneider Electric. Within Scope 3 US
EPA EEIO v1.3 was primarily used for spend-based
calculations, with DEFRA 2024 used for activitybased calculations.

Software Carbon Footprint
When it comes to cloud software, environmental
costs as externalities can be hidden. With the
rise of AI and compute-intensive software,
increased use of energy and water is becoming
a top priority for technology companies
globally. At IFS, we have a responsibility to
consider these externalities across the product
lifecycle. This means from the design stage,
where we have the most control over how our
software will run efficiently, through to the use
stage, IFS , where we collaborate with our cloud
partners on the energy and water consumption
in data centers hosting IFS.
Our focus is on minimizing the carbon footprint
of AI systems, adopting green coding practices
and promoting sustainable solutions for the
industries we serve. We seek to align with the
principles of the Green Software Foundation as
regards carbon efficiency in development of
software, energy efficiency in its operation, and
carbon awareness. IFS design our solutions to
run efficiently, with increasing components of
our software on ‘next generation’ architecture
that scales to near zero when not in use. In 2025,
we will pilot training on green software to our
engineers so these principles are considered
in the design and development stage. We will
also benchmark our software to understand its
comparative carbon footprint.
On data centres, we work closely with our
cloud partner Microsoft Azure to assess the
environmental impact of their data centres.
The majority are powered by renewable
electricity and there are initiatives in place such
as innovative liquid immersion cooling methods
to reduce water and energy consumption for
AI chips. Having a central cloud hosting gives
us visibility on total emissions associated with
IFS Cloud, as well as the ability to provide
customers with their emissions from software
use, and approximate reduction compared to
on premise applications.

Sustainable Procurement
We recognize our supply chain as a vital part of
our overall environmental footprint and continue
to promote sustainable practices in our supply
chain through specific sustainability criteria
in our standard supplier terms and conditions.
We also seek to continuously optimize
procurement of goods and services through
cost management initiatives that also provide
sustainability benefits.
Strategy and 2024 progress
See dedicated section for more information
on page 27.

Beyond-Value-Chain Mitigation
We recognize the vital role that the private
sector needs to play in scaling vital markets and
technologies outside its immediate value chain
to achieve planetary net zero. With the negative
impacts of climate change continuing to grow,
the world is looking to businesses to accelerate
the pace of change. At IFS, alongside
decarbonization initiatives targeted at our own
operations and value chain, we actively invest in
carbon projects to support the scaling of global
carbon removals markets.

Carbon Credit Strategy
IFS’ carbon investment strategy is designed
to deliver positive impact for the planet by
supporting the scaling of the carbon removals
market whilst providing benefits for our
business. Through our partnership with Patch,

Our People
As we continue to grow and evolve
as an organization, we recognize
that our success is built on the
strength of our people.
At IFS, we believe every person deserves to feel
valued, respected, and empowered to thrive.
Our commitment to fostering an inclusive, fair,
and equitable workplace is not just a statement—
it is the foundation of high-performing, diverse
teams that drive innovation and success for our
business globally. Our 2029 vision recognizes
the importance of high-performing, diverse
teams as a central contributor to achieving our
ambition.
This year, we facilitated several diversity
projects, including ongoing annual initiatives,
such as continued support for IFS Women
Employee Resource Groups, as well as new
global projects focused on minority groups.
A compelling example is the "I Am Remarkable"
program, which was successfully launched
in 2024. It aims to empower individuals to
celebrate their achievements. The series of
workshops focus on improving self-promotion
skills and building confidence in a supportive
group setting. It is currently available for our
teams in the UK and Sri Lanka; however, we plan
to expand it globally in 2025.

Celebrating Our Global Diversity
At IFS, we use awareness days as opportunities
to celebrate diversity, launch supporting
initiatives, and educate our employees. In
2024, IFS proudly celebrated several diversity
awareness days, including International
Women’s Day, Black History Month, LGBTQ+
History Month, International Men’s Day, and
others.
We always strive to infuse creativity into our
campaigns. As part of this effort, in 2024,
our design team created custom lock screen
designs to reflect and honor the unique values,
aesthetics, and celebrations of different
communities.

Supporting the Growth
of Female Leadership
In 2024, we established Future Manager
Development Program with high emphasis on
female participation. The program aims to equip
IFS employees who aspire to become people
managers in their journey at IFS. The program
involves a combination of mentoring, e-learning
and structured group discussions that provide
participants with knowledge and skills required
to become effective people managers.

2024 Gender Diversity
The technology industry continues to be
predominantly male-dominated, and IFS
is actively working to change this. We are
committed to helping women establish and
grow their careers in technology by offering
additional opportunities for success and
advancement. In 2024, IFS has increased the
number of female managers to 33.02% of the
business (2023: 31.91%).

Employee engagement
Engaging and retaining a motivated workforce
is a key priority for us, which involves actively
seeking, listening to, and responding to
employee feedback. As we continue to grow,
our global employee engagement survey
provides an important opportunity for
employees to share candid feedback about
their experience at IFS. The ideas and
suggestions from our employees play a vital
role in helping us refine our work practices and
culture, ultimately shaping the future of IFS.
To track progress, IFS conducts the Heartbeat
survey two times a year, which is sent to
all employees. This concise, regular survey
allows us to consistently measure employee
engagement and adjust questions to focus on
specific themes, while also maintaining a core
set of questions.
In 2024, we maintained best-in-class
participation rates for our survey, achieving
a global participation rate of 93% with a total
of 18,300 comments. We believe that the high
participation rates and the volume of comments
reflect an actively engaged workforce, eager
to provide feedback and collaborate on future
improvements.

many ways, and there’s no single “right” way
of thinking, learning, or behaving. It recognizes
brain differences, such as those seen in ADHD,
autism, dyslexia, and other conditions, are
natural variations in the human population,
much like diversity in race or gender.
The main mission of our Neurodiversity ERG
is to foster an inclusive environment where
neurodivergent individuals feel valued,
understood, and empowered to reach their
full potential.

Another example of our strong
commitment to employee
wellbeing is the establishment
of a Neurodiversity Employee
Resource Group (ERG)
dedicated to supporting
our global IFS community.

This year, we celebrate the fourth

At IFS, safeguarding fundamental
rights related to dignity, fairness,
respect, and equality is a core
commitment.
We are dedicated to upholding the human rights
of our employees, ensuring they are treated
with dignity and respect in accordance with
international standards. All employees and
business partners are expected to adhere to the
principles outlined in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. As part of our commitment,
we follow the UN Guiding Principles on Business

Cybersecurity
& Privacy
Given the ever-evolving nature
of cyber threats, IFS employs an
adaptive and proactive strategy.
The IFS Cybersecurity program incorporates
strong technological safeguards, proactive
threat detection and response systems, and
fosters a culture of cyber awareness among our
employees. This multi-layered approach ensures
we stay ahead of the curve.
Built to Adapt
At the heart of our efforts is the IFS Internal
Information Security Management System
(ISMS). Designed in accordance with globally
recognized security frameworks such as ISO
27001, SSAE18/ISAE3402, SOC 1 & 2, and the
National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), this system is in constant review and
evolves in tandem to industry best practices
and emerging threats.
As a result, IFS has been able to maintain an
impeccable record with no major security
incidents nor data breaches for 6th year in
a row. This milestone is a testament to our
commitment to protecting the data and privacy
of our stakeholders in an increasingly complex
digital landscape.

No major security incidents
nor data breaches for 6th
year in a row.

Key 2024 updates
IFS continues to strengthen our cybersecurity posture,
and this year has driven multiple key initiatives:

	Our approach to tax planning is to align any
choices with commercial and economic
substance and regard to the potential impact
on our reputation and broader goals. We
will not undertake planning that is contrived,
artificial or knowingly contradictory to the
intent of the legislation.

IFS Group actively seeks to identify, evaluate,
monitor, and manage tax risks. We are
committed to correctly applying the tax
legislation to our business operations having our
communities in mind, and we intend to conduct
our tax affairs to the highest standards and to
comply with all applicable anti-bribery, money
laundering and anti-tax evasion legislation.
Internal controls and escalation procedures
are put in place with the aim of identifying,
quantifying, and managing key tax risks.

IFS’ Chief Financial Officer (CFO) has executive
responsibility for tax matters, while the
ultimate responsibility for tax strategy, its
approval, and compliance rests with the Group
Board. They work towards ensuring that the
appropriate framework is in place to oversee
the identification and management of tax
risk. Day-to-day management of tax affairs
is delegated to the Global Head of Treasury
and Tax for corporate income tax, indirect
taxes and withholding tax, and to the Chief
Human Resources Officer for employment
taxes. They are supported by local finance
and payroll teams who work on an integrated
basis to identify and manage tax risks utilizing
their combined knowledge of operations
and law. The Group CFO, together with the
Global Head of Treasury and Tax and, where
relevant, the Chief Human Resources Officer,
conduct regular assessments on significant tax
developments and participate in all material
tax-related decisions.

The Group Audit & Risk Committee oversees
IFS’ tax control environment through the regular
review of the tax strategy.
Appropriate training is carried out for staff who
manage or process tax matters. We recognize
that tax legislation can be complex and
sometimes subject to interpretation and this
uncertainty could give rise to tax risk. Where
there is uncertainty in how the relevant tax law
should be applied, external advice is sought to
support the Group’s decision-making process.
Where tax positions are subject to significant
unresolved uncertainty, filing positions should
be subject to robust risk assessment and
supported by full disclosure. We may also look
to engage with global tax authorities (“Tax
Authorities”) to disclose and resolve issues, risks,
and uncertain tax positions.
We ensure documentation is collected and
retained for at least the minimum statute of
limitations period and if under audit, a time
period needed to satisfy such activities.

Supporting
Our Customers
IFS strives to enable a more sustainable
future, both through our own actions and by
supporting our customers. In 2024, we made
further progress with a focus on embedding
sustainability across our product offerings.
This is achieved in three ways:
1. Developing new products that address
growing disclosure requirements
2. Integrating sustainability into existing
products, and
3. Enhancing and promoting products
that already support customers in their
sustainability initiatives.

Strategic Focus for IFS Cloud
With IFS Cloud, our unique positioning enables
us to effectively navigate the sustainability
landscape. Our open architecture and
comprehensive portfolio of solutions provide
a solid foundation to help customers embed
sustainability into their business strategies.
We strongly believe that sustainability should
never be treated as a standalone effort; it is
only successful when embedded within an
organization’s business strategy and day-today operations. This is why "Sustainability
Embedded" is at the heart of our message.
We specifically focus on data at the source,
strategically positioning relevant environmental
and social data where it logically fits in with our
customers' business processes.

Product Direction
Success in sustainability lies in its seamless
integration into business strategy and
operations. Our goal is to embed sustainability
capability in the core of our IFS products. Over
the past year, we have identified five key longterm investment areas that we prioritize, forming
the foundation of our overall product strategy
for sustainability.

STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS

Collaborating
with PwC UK for
IFS’ New Module
Sustainability is most effectively achieved
through collaboration, with a strong emphasis
on knowledge sharing.
In 2024, IFS have collaborated with PwC UK
to develop a CSRD KPI catalog as part of our
new Sustainability Management Module. We
provide value by combining PwC UK's expertise
in ESG criteria and the ever-evolving regulatory
landscape with IFS’ technical capabilities. We
have also successfully mapped a subset of CSRD
key performance indicators in 2024, including
metrics like employee turnover rate, total full-time
employees, and gender statistics.
Looking forward, we will keep broadening the
scope of our module, mapping additional KPIs and
ensuring a supporting embedding sustainability
into our customers’ business processes. Once
completed, the solution will help IFS customers
navigate the new requirements of the CSRD and
other emerging mainstream global regulatory
standards that our customers are facing.

Accurate and comprehensive ESG
data is essential for organizations
to monitor progress, identify
improvement opportunities, and
comply with regulations. Reliable
data also enables businesses to
make informed decisions, be
transparent with stakeholders,
and build trust. Through our
collaboration with IFS and their
Sustainability Management Module
in IFS Cloud, we leverage our PwC
ESG expertise and regulatory
knowledge to provide valuable
guidance, insights and support.
This enables organizations to
effectively deliver their corporate
sustainability objectives,
and navigate the evolving
regulatory landscape.”

Sustainability Management

To continuously enhance our offerings and
provide more sustainability-focused solutions
to our customers, Emissions Tracker has evolved
into Emissions Management in IFS Cloud
launching early 2025. This evolution strengthens
our embedded solutions, leveraging existing
IFS Cloud functionality and allowing customers
to reuse their asset hierarchy and integrate
available activity data from IFS Cloud. Emissions
Management will bring several benefits,
including:
Access to over 70,000+ Verified Emission
Factors: Our partnership with Climatiq brings
in one of the largest and up-to-date carbon
impact databases, enabling businesses to gain
carbon visibility and drive meaningful emission
reductions.
Out of the box pre-configured templates: Preconfigured emission templates will automate
most of the configuration work required for
emission calculation
Seamless integration with Asset
Management: Ability to reuse asset hierarchy
and existing emission sources data from Asset
Management for consistency

Our vision is centered around providing
our customers with seamless access to
sustainability data within IFS Cloud. As part
of this effort, we introduced a dedicated
Sustainability Management Module. This assists
companies in aligning with new regulation such
as CSRD. IFS Cloud Sustainability Management
Module makes it easier for businesses to
efficiently manage and disclose sustainability
data, boosting visibility of sustainability
performance across the organization.

In 2024, IFS has started utilizing this tool to
monitor our own corporate emissions. This
hands-on experience with our own product
provides valuable insights into our customers'
journey, allowing us to continuously make
informed adjustments to the product.

Circular Operations
We have continued to strengthen our
support for circular operations within IFS
Cloud. A significant recognition of our progress
is IFS being named as a leader in the latest
remanufacturing IDC MarketScape.
Through 2024, our capabilities in circular
operations served as a central and
differentiating factor for customers selecting
IFS Cloud. This is a strong testament to how we
can help our customers transform to a circular
economy.
Service management also plays a major role in
circular operations. IFS enables the extension
of customer-owned product lifespans through
preventative maintenance and repair processes.
With a full lifecycle view, IFS supports part
refurbishment and environmentally responsible
disposal and recycling practices.
IDC highlighted IFS’ strengths in AI-powered
Planning and Scheduling Optimization and our
multi-focused field service offering that meets
the needs of resource, customer, outcome,
project, and asset-centric environments.

Supply Chain Sustainability
This year, we focused on enhancing our
Procurement and Supply Chain functionalities
to assist customers in addressing sustainability
challenges, particularly by tackling Scope 3
emissions.
Through this initiative, we introduced new
functionality to manage ‘Emissions in
Procurement,’ enabling our customers to make
significant progress toward sustainability
by more effectively tracking their emissions.
This aligns with our vision of Sustainability
Embedded, allowing emissions insights to be
accessed directly at the source in Procurement.
This new feature empowers Procurement teams
to track and store carbon emission data for
purchased goods and services, leveraging
a variety of sources in a robust and flexible
platform. It supports both activity-based and
spend-based emission calculation methods.
Users can input emission data collected
internally, directly from suppliers via B2B portals,
or through scientifically validated external data
sources.
This emission data is used throughout the
Procurement processes to make informed
decisions at every step of the way. The benefit
of these enhancements is not only enjoyed by
Procurement organizations but also contribute
to overall organizational emission management,
emissions capture in manufacturing processes,
and beyond.
We are also prioritizing enhanced supply
chain sustainability by expanding our supplier
evaluation capabilities to include environmental
and social supplier metrics.
This empowers customers to make
sustainability-driven decisions during their
sourcing and supplier onboarding processes.

Performant & Sustainability Assets
Asset performance management helps
our customers to understand the condition,
performance and expected availability of
their assets. It also leverages insights to reduce
unplanned asset downtime, drive predictive
maintenance, optimize energy and resources,
and enhance their asset planning strategies.
Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality
Analysis (FMECA)
In 2024, we successfully integrated FMECA
(Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis)
into IFS Cloud, enabling our customers to
conduct a Risk-Based Assessment for any
critical or complex asset.

FMECA is a systematic approach used to
identify and evaluate potential failures and
failure modes. It utilizes a criticality matrix to
assess and prioritize these failure modes based
on their severity, probability, and detectability.
This capability allows customers to create and
adjust maintenance strategies, effectively
minimizing the impact of the most critical
failures.
Anomaly detection
Another significant integration is the
introduction of anomaly detection with
Operational Intelligence (OI), which allows us to
identify sub-optimal performance in assets that
may lead to increased energy consumption or
emissions.
This tool enables automated anomaly
handling, guiding users on the next steps to
take when an anomaly is detected, ensuring
timely intervention and optimization of energy
efficiency and emissions control.

IFS Foundation
We leverage the global fundraising capabilities
of IFS to support our charity of choice, the IFS
Foundation. The IFS Foundation helps kids in
underserved Sri Lankan communities access
a decent education, investing in projects that
improve access to clean water, sanitation,
healthcare, school infrastructure, and
employment opportunities.
Through 2024, we organized multiple fundraising
initiatives by promoting the IFS Foundation
across various channels. We always aim
to implement creative ways to engage our
colleagues, spreading awareness of the work
we do. For instance, every year, IFS publishes
a special book to support the IFS Foundation.
In the past, we have produced a cookbook
with recipes and a travel guide featuring our
colleagues’ recommendations. This year, we
invited colleagues to share photos of their
homes or workspaces, which we then used
to create a collective photo album.
As a result of our collective efforts, the IFS
Foundation raised over $300,000 in 2024,
including contributions from IFS employees,
partners and shareholder community.

Building Meaningful
Partnerships to Promote STEM
The Hg Foundation, a grant-giving
charity focused on improving tech
education and skills, partnered with IFS
and the IFS Foundation to promote STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics) skills in remote and rural
communities in Sri Lanka.
The £64,000 grant from the Hg Foundation
will fund the construction of a computer
lab and staff training to deliver IT and STEM
classes in the village of Weralugahamula.
This crucial infrastructure will help ensure
that children in the community have access
to quality education.

This year, we have also made tangible
progress across projects in three villages,
Welusumanapura, Weralugahamula and
Madampe.

Inspiring the Younger
Generation: STEM Career Fairs
As part of the IFS Education Program,
we have partnered with IEEE to run STEM
career fairs and talks in schools and
colleges across Sri Lanka.

The IFS Education Program aims to foster
interest and engagement in STEM subjects while
expanding opportunities and creating pathways
into the technology sector for young people. We
achieve this through four key methods: providing
scholarships and internships, utilizing IFS
software, donating equipment, and encouraging
employees to volunteer their time.

One of the first career fairs in 2024 took
place at Galigamuwa Central College. The
team talked about careers in STEM and the
opportunities available for the students.
Some of the feedback we received from the
students attending these events:

I was blind about my future
until the session. Now, I know
the path to achieve my ambition
to be a lawyer.”

As part of this program, every year we:
 onate software and hardware such as laptops

Volunteering
The CSR Volunteer Day is one way
in which we enable colleagues to
play an active role in directly
supporting our Sustainability
strategy.
In 2024, 25% of IFS employees
volunteered, beating our target
of 20% and achieving a growth
of 5x since 2021

We give every colleague one day of paid
volunteering leave to spend time supporting
their local communities and organizations close
to their hearts.
In 2024, we demonstrated compelling progress
as 25% of IFS employees volunteered, beating
our target of 20% and achieving a growth of
5x since 2021. This compares to an industry
average of 11% and global benchmark of 9%
corporate volunteering uptake.* We’re proud to
see community engagement becoming part of
our culture, including kicking off 2025 with the
largest corporate volunteering event IFS has
held to date.

How CSR Volunteer Days are Being Used Around the World
During last year, IFS teams volunteered their time to support activities as varied as beach
cleans, hospital painting and blood donations. Some of the standout team activities include:

Sri Lanka

Germany

Denmark

In Sri Lanka, our colleagues from the
Engineering Hub Team spent their
CSR day supporting Hewagama
Junior School by conducting a
workshop for its teachers. The
session covered MS PowerPoint,
presentation creation with tips and
tricks, as well as an introductory IT
session to enhance their skills.

IFS colleagues used their CSR
day by helping local church and
kindergarten to prepare for the
St. Martins celebrations. The team
was involved in baking St. Martin's
cookies, as well as preparing
a farmstead for the evening
celebrations.

IFS team committed to volunteer
for Red Cross as part of their CSR
day. The team spent their day
volunteering in a secondhand
store, where they helped to sort and
display for sale the donated items,
as well as picking up donations.

IFS Executive Leadership Team Stepped Up
to Lead by Example
In partnership with the Thomas Franks
Foundation, our IFS Executive team
packaged 500 meal portions that would
have otherwise gone to landfill. These meals
were then distributed to various groups in
the Southeast England area, including the
homeless and those reliant on food banks.

IFS Ultimo Joins the UNICEF
Business Buddies Program
In 2024, IFS Ultimo became a part of the UNICEF
Business Buddies program, which aims to help
children in the Ivory Coast access education.
The Plastic Bricks project not only promotes
education in the region but also works towards
creating a cleaner environment. A local UNICEF
recycling plant purchases plastic waste and
transforms it into plastic building bricks. These
bricks are then used to construct classrooms.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors
and the Executive Management for the
Sustainability Report
The Board of Directors and Executive
Management are responsible for the
preparation of the Sustainability Report in
accordance with applicable criteria. The criteria
are defined on page 47 in the Sustainability
Report and consist of the GRI Sustainability
Reporting Standards, as well as the accounting
and calculation principles that the company
has developed. This responsibility includes the
internal control relevant to the preparation of
a Sustainability Report that is free from material
misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
Responsibilities of the Auditor
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion
on the above specified information based on
the limited assurance procedures we have
performed. The selection of information to be
reviewed has been made by the management of
IGT. Our review is limited to the above specified
information in this document and does not
include future oriented information.
We conducted our limited assurance
engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000
(Revised) Assurance engagements other
than audits or reviews of historical financial
information. A limited assurance engagement
consists of making inquiries, primarily of
persons responsible for the preparation of the
Sustainability Report, and applying analytical
and other limited assurance procedures.

The procedures performed in a limited
assurance engagement vary in nature from,
and are less in scope than for, a reasonable
assurance engagement conducted in
accordance with IAASB’s Standards on
Auditing and other generally accepted auditing
standards.
The firm applies International Standard on
Quality Management 1, which requires that
we design, implement and operate a system
of quality management including policies or
procedures regarding compliance with ethical
requirements, professional standards and
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
We are independent of IGT in accordance
with professional ethics for accountants in
Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements.
The procedures performed, consequently, do
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would
become aware of all significant matters that
might be identified in a reasonable assurance
engagement. Accordingly, we do not express
a reasonable assurance conclusion.
Our procedures are based on the criteria
defined by the Board of Directors and the
Executive Management as described above.
We consider these criteria suitable for the
preparation of the Sustainability Report. We
believe that the evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our conclusion below.

Conclusion
Based on the limited assurance procedures
we have performed, nothing has come to our
attention that causes us to believe that the
above specified information is not prepared,
in all material respects, in accordance with the
criteria defined by the Board of Directors and
Executive Management.

E1-5 Energy Consumption and Mix
(Percentage of renewable energy in
IGT III operations)

Renewable electricity (RE) is generated from renewable
resources, which are naturally replenished on a human
timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves,
and geothermal heat. IFS purchases Energy Attribute
Certificates (EACs) to cover its grid electricity consumption
across global facilities that are under its operational
control. 1 EAC represents 1 MWh of verified 100% RE
generated by a provider. Green tariffs refer to contracts for
100% RE that usually consist of bundled EACs. Purchasing
EACs therefore enables IFS to decarbonize its electricity
supply.

IFS sites under operational
control

Managed and reported via IFS
Cloud Emissions Management,
our proprietary energy and
emissions calculation software.

IFS reports direct GHG emissions from sources under
operational control as IFS Scope 1. Emissions are
generated from stationary combustion of fuels (natural
gas and fuel oil) at global facilities.
 IFS purchases electricity, district heating and district
cooling for consumption at global facilities under
its operational control. The indirect GHG emissions
released from the generation of this purchased energy
by utilities and power generators is reported as IFS Scope
2. IFS reports its Scope 2 emissions under both locationbased and market-based approaches as defined by the
Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2

E1-7 GHG removals and GHG
mitigation projects financed
through Carbon Credits
(quantitative only)

 

IFS invests in a portfolio of carbon removal and GHG
mitigation projects to support scaling of the global
carbon removals market.
 These projects are financed through carbon credits.
One credit equals one tonne of carbon dioxide
equivalent (tCO2e) removed or avoided.
 Carbon credits can be “retired” or “cancelled” in a
different year to the investment year. Under ESRS E1-7
we will specify and report the carbon credits that are
cancelled in the reporting year.
 

Purchased and reported via
