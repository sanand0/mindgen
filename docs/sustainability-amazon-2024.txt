How We Work

Goals Summary

2024 Year in Review

Amazon is a unique company. The diverse nature of our
business allows us to test new sustainability solutions across
industries. When we discover a solution in one area, we can
quickly adopt it across our business, helping us move faster
toward our sustainability goals. As a customer-obsessed
company, we find this approach helps us make our customers’
lives better and easier every day, while making our operations
more sustainable.
We’re developing cutting-edge AI, delivering packages at
record speeds, creating award-winning entertainment,
advancing healthcare solutions, and promoting global
broadband access—while simultaneously reducing waste,
expanding carbon-free energy, using lower-carbon building
materials, protecting forests, protecting and furthering
human rights, and helping our communities recover from
global disasters.
Amazon’s culture also encourages us to ask “Why?” at every
turn. When we ask why sustainability matters, the answer
is clear: Sustainability is not separate from our customer
obsession—it’s an extension of it. Solutions that benefit
the environment can create superior experiences for
our customers and also become economic drivers that
help strengthen communities and protect the planet.
In 2024, we demonstrated this repeatedly across our
business, with sustainability innovations directly enhancing
customer experiences. For example, our ongoing packaging
innovations meant customers had fewer boxes to break
down and now zero air pillows to pop.
2024 also marked a turning point for artificial intelligence
(AI). It’s a transformative technology that we believe
will reinvent virtually every customer experience, as well
as create new experiences that we only once dreamed
would be possible. Over the last few years, Amazon has
accelerated its investments in generative AI to build these
experiences across our business and, including through the
1,000-plus AI applications we’re developing across Amazon.
We introduced Amazon Q, the most capable AI-powered
coding assistant; SageMaker, a service that makes it easier
to build foundation models; Amazon Bedrock, which allows
developers to do GenAI inference at scale; our own frontier
model, Amazon Nova, to give customers leading intelligence
at lower latency and cost; and we’re rolling out Alexa+, our

next-generation Alexa personal assistant that’s meaningfully
smarter, more capable, and is the first personal assistant
that can take significant actions for customers. We’ve also
harnessed AI as a powerful sustainability tool—optimizing
sizing recommendations to reduce returns, identifying
energy inefficiencies, detecting water leaks, and avoiding
packaging—solving countless environmental challenges
while simultaneously improving service quality. And we’re
just at the beginning.
As we harness generative AI’s potential and our AI
business continues to grow rapidly, we are investing in the
infrastructure that we’ll need to make AI innovation possible.
We’re also tackling one of its greatest challenges head on,
rising energy demand. Rather than viewing this as a limitation
for sustainability, we see it as an opportunity we’re facing
head-on to pioneer sustainability solutions at scale through
our AWS business for our customers and our suppliers.
In 2024, we unveiled breakthrough data center innovations
in power systems, cooling technology, and hardware
architecture that will simultaneously support next-generation
AI capabilities while improving energy efficiency—proving
that technological progress and sustainability can advance
in tandem. We’re also diversifying and expanding our
carbon-free energy portfolio, which includes our first
investments in nuclear energy, alongside maintaining our
position as the world’s largest corporate purchaser of
renewable energy for the fifth consecutive year. Through
these complementary approaches—optimizing efficiency
while scaling carbon-free energy—we’re creating a more
sustainable foundation that AI needs to fulfill its
world-changing potential.
AI is already embedded in much of this work, but when
our customers think about sustainability at Amazon, it’s
most often associated with our retail business, which we’ve
made more sustainable too. In 2024, we delivered at faster
speeds than ever before, with 10 billion items delivered
the same or next day around the world. At the same time,
our growing fleet of over 30,000 electric delivery vehicles
helped deliver 1.5 billion packages globally. Across our global
operations, we eliminated all plastic air pillows and replaced
them with recyclable paper filler. We also reduced our total
plastic packaging by 16.4%. We’ve been keenly focused on

preventing and diverting waste, and in 2024, 85% of our
waste was diverted from landfill.
As we continue to champion sustainability solutions for
our customers, we’re doing the same for our partners and
suppliers. As of today, over 550 companies have committed
to The Climate Pledge and are choosing to come together to
drive joint action and fast-track decarbonization solutions.
In that same spirit of collaboration, we’re engaging our
suppliers to set their own sustainability goals. To accelerate
collective progress, we launched The Sustainability Exchange,
sharing our playbooks and previously proprietary insights
freely with businesses worldwide. This collaborative approach
multiplies our impact by allowing companies to build on proven
solutions, combines our collective resources to tackle our
greatest environmental challenges, and drives industry-wide
momentum with a powerful blend of urgency and optimism.
Looking ahead, we recognize that the path to being a more
sustainable company will never be linear, because we’re
charting new territory at an unprecedented scale. While we
are firm on our goals, our approach will continuously evolve
with emerging challenges and opportunities, as we’re seeing
with the rapid adoption of AI. No matter what we’re faced
with in the future, we’ll remain steadfast in our commitment
to sustainability and will continue to invest, innovate, and
obsess over our progress each year, with the same intensity
and focus that has defined Amazon from Day One.
The progress demonstrated in this report is the result of the
years of work by thousands of Amazonians who have never
stopped asking “Why?” to find better and more sustainable
solutions. This questioning mindset has uncovered innovative
ways to reduce waste, cut emissions, and improve efficiency.
I’m confident our habit of asking tough questions will
lead to continued breakthrough solutions for decades to
come. Thank you to everyone—our teams, partners, and
customers—who have helped turn these questions into
real-world progress.
With gratitude,
Kara Hurst
Chief Sustainability Officer

and Energy
Our Approach
Amazon is investing in new solutions to decarbonize our
business by using our size, scale, and resources to drive
progress across our supply chain and the industries in
which we operate.1
Through The Climate Pledge , which we co-founded and
committed to in 2019, our goal is to reach net-zero carbon
emissions across our global operations by 2040, while
inspiring and inviting others to take action. We recognize
that progress will not always be linear, but we remain
focused on serving our customers better, faster, and with
fewer emissions.
Our strategy is aligned with climate science and embeds
decarbonization initiatives and efficiency improvements
across our business and supply chain. Teams across
Amazon are accountable for setting decarbonization
plans that map back to Amazon’s worldwide strategy, as
ownership and accountability are essential to operational
success and managing complexity. We focus on four
cross-cutting initiatives to decarbonize our business:
• Driving efficiency across our global operations. We
identify and implement efficiency initiatives across
Amazon, such as improving transportation routing,
increasing pack and fill rates, improving cloud-computing
chip efficiency, adding Low Power Mode to devices, and
installing energy-efficiency solutions in buildings.

Biodiversity

Human Rights

Responsible Supply Chain

Sustainable Products

• Deploying lower-carbon alternatives. We use
lower-carbon options when practicable, such as
lower-carbon concrete and steel during construction,
recycled and bio-based plastics in data center
components, and lower-emission fuels and vehicles
for transportation.
• Investing in carbon-free electricity. We invest in
carbon-free energy, such as on-site solar, utility-scale
solar and wind, nuclear, as well as battery energy
storage to collect and store carbon-free energy. 2
• Engaging with suppliers. We actively engage,
support, and incentivize suppliers to join Amazon’s
decarbonization journey by setting credible goals,
implementing emissions reduction strategies, and
transparently sharing their progress, and we create
industry solutions that our suppliers can utilize, like the
Amazon Sustainability Exchange .
Beyond our own operations, we are working to accelerate
decarbonization across industries and with suppliers by:
• Catalyzing industry-wide action. We bring
companies together from around the world through
The Climate Pledge, driving collective action,
cross-sector collaboration, and engagement in
initiatives that encourage industry-wide measures
to promote decarbonization.
• Investing in innovation. We adopt ready-to-scale
solutions, and we evaluate and invest in emerging
technologies through The Climate Pledge Fund —
including those that can help address emissions from
hard-to-abate sectors. We also provide direct
funding to accelerate the widespread adoption
of such emerging technologies.
• Supporting policies that drive decarbonization.
We work with policymakers, governments,
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), industry
associations, coalitions, and other organizations on

• Catalyzing climate finance and market-based
mechanisms. We use mechanisms (e.g., insets and book
and claim) to spur development of decarbonization
technologies and transform the sectors in which
we operate. This allows us to make progress on
commodities where decarbonization solutions are
not yet available within our direct supply chain.
• Neutralizing remaining emissions. While our first
priority is to eliminate emissions within our value
chain, we are also investing in climate mitigation
solutions outside of our value chain as a contribution
to global climate action. Our approach focuses on
direct investment, advance purchase agreements,
coalition building, new methodology development,
and technological innovation.

commitment. We measure both absolute emissions and
carbon intensity to provide a complete picture of our
progress toward our 2040 goal. Absolute emissions are
critical to our end goal, and carbon intensity helps us
assess the effectiveness of our actions along the way.
This type of comprehensive measurement is not only
important for us, but it is also useful for our customers
and partners, so they can understand how investments
across our value chain are driving real progress.
After two years of decreasing absolute carbon emissions,
we saw a 6% increase in 2024.7 This is where carbon
intensity helps us examine whether we’re employing the
right solutions in the near term, and decoupling emissions
from business growth. 8 In 2024, we achieved a 4%
reduction in carbon intensity compared to 2023, with 11%
business growth during the same period. We have also
seen a sustained reduction in carbon intensity year over
year and have reduced our carbon intensity approximately
40% since committing to The Climate Pledge in 2019. 9
As we continue toward our 2040 goal, our progress will
not be linear, but we will remain focused on investing in
long-term solutions, optimizing for network efficiencies,
helping our supply chain decarbonize, and innovating with
our partners in the hard-to-abate parts of our business.

Direct Emissions
Amazon’s direct emissions are primarily generated from
the fuel used by our transportation and logistics fleet to
deliver packages to customers, and refrigerants to keep
buildings and products cool. One way we address this is
by continually refining our strategy to reduce emissions
generated during the full journey of an Amazon package—
from its origins with the manufacturer to the doorstep of
the customer.
We know that speed matters to our customers, which is
why we invest in our logistics and delivery capabilities
to optimize for faster deliveries while prioritizing
sustainability. For example, we’ve optimized our inventory
placement to shorten the distance products have to

travel to our customers. By dividing our operations
and transportation networks into smaller regions and
stocking more of the products our customers want locally
customers can get the products they want quickly and we
can utilize more sustainable modes of transport to deliver
those products to them. In 2024, we avoided millions of
miles due to increased efficiency from this regionalization
effort and expect to accelerate this progress in coming
years. Additionally, we continue to optimize how we fill
our trucks and are increasing the use of electric vehicles
(EVs). And when we can’t use EVs, we use lower-carbon
transportation modes, such as alternative fuel vehicles,
where possible. By the end of 2024, we had reduced the
carbon emissions per shipped unit by roughly one-third
since 2019. Specific examples include:
• Offering customers shipping options that improve
routing, by combining products into one delivery. In
2024, Prime members in the U.S. saved an estimated
452 million delivery trips, which helped avoid the use of
more than 494 million boxes and the generation
of 335,000 metric tons of CO2e. Learn more about how
we are improving routing efficiency
• Expanding our electric delivery fleet by delivering 1.5
billion packages to customers using more than 31,400
electric delivery vans and other EVs. To support our
expanding EV network, we installed 11,770 chargers
at 50 delivery stations, creating the largest private
charging network in the U.S. In early 2025, we also
announced our largest order of zero-tailpipe-emission
heavy goods vehicles, with more than 200 new
Mercedes-Benz Trucks eActros 600 vehicles set to join
our transportation network in Europe. These vehicles
are expected to transport 338 million packages per year
when fully operational. Learn more about how we are
scaling up EVs
• Scaling lower-carbon fuels. In 2024, Amazon procured

more about how we are scaling lower-carbon fuels
Our direct emissions increased 6% compared to 2023, as
our business continued to grow and we navigated global
supply constraints for EVs and low-carbon fuels. This
reinforces the importance of our leadership in creating
stronger demand signals for lower-carbon transportation
solutions through buyers’ alliances, partnerships with
industry leaders, policymakers, and other companies.

Indirect Emissions from Purchased Electricity
Our indirect emissions from purchased electricity primarily
come from electricity used to power buildings and charge
EVs at our facilities. Two of the most effective ways we
manage indirect emissions from purchased electricity are
by transitioning to carbon-free energy sources and by
improving energy efficiency.
Nuclear power is a key component of our carbon-free
energy strategy, in addition to using renewable energy
sources such as wind and solar. In 2024, we signed
agreements to support nuclear energy projects, including
the development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). SMRs
feature a compact design that enables faster construction
closer to power grids, which allows for more rapid
deployment than traditional reactors. Additionally, as of
January 2025, we had invested in 621 renewable energy
projects—including 124 new projects in 2024 alone—
representing 34 GW of carbon-free energy capacity.

carbon-free energy
Today, in virtually every corner of Amazon, we’re using
generative AI to make customers’ lives better and easier—
and while we’ve made a lot of progress, we’re still at the
relative beginning. One of the biggest challenges with
scaling AI is increased energy demands for data centers.

Biodiversity

Human Rights

Responsible Supply Chain

Sustainable Products

This increased energy demand is from AI chips, which
are vital for machine learning models, but require more
electricity and cooling than traditional chips given the
higher speeds at which they complete mathematical
calculations.11 We are laser-focused on improving energy
efficiency, which we measure through Power Usage
Effectiveness (PUE). In 2024, AWS reported a global
PUE of 1.15—better than both the public cloud industry
average of 1.25 and 1.63 for on-premises enterprise
data centers, as estimated by the International Data
Corporation.12 A lower PUE value indicates greater
efficiency (with the theoretical minimum PUE being 1.0),
and indicates that using AWS to power AI innovation is
a lower-emission option than most. We achieved this
success from optimized data center designs, energyefficient custom chips, and advanced cooling technologies.
For example, new AWS data center components
introduced in 2024 deliver 12% more computing power
and reduce peak cooling energy consumption by 46%
compared to previous designs, all without increasing
water usage. Learn more about how we’re improving
energy efficiency to power AI innovation
For the past two years, 100% of the electricity consumed
by Amazon was matched with renewable energy sources.
This helps us reduce carbon emissions, but doesn’t
eliminate them. We saw a 1% increase in our indirect
emissions from purchased electricity in 2024, in part due to
the higher electricity usage required to support advanced
technologies. This underscores why it’s important to scale
carbon-free energy sources to continue to deliver the
advanced technologies our customers need.

Indirect Emissions from Other Sources
Indirect emissions from other sources are from activities
beyond our direct operations, including building materials
and construction, third-party transportation, and the
production of Amazon-branded products and their
components by our suppliers.

Employee Experience

We aim to reduce embodied carbon in building construction
by using lower-emission concrete, lower-emission steel and
aluminum, and mass timber. In 2024, 49 Amazon building
projects incorporated lower-carbon building materials and
finishes, avoiding at least 77,000 metric tons of embodied
CO2e.13 Learn more about how we are reducing embodied
carbon in our buildings
Reducing indirect emissions from other sources requires
engaging our suppliers on their efforts to decarbonize. It
is important that all suppliers understand their business
and how they will decarbonize, and that they have a
plan to do so. To enable that, we are open-sourcing
information and making playbooks available through
the Sustainability Exchange , a free, publicly available
website offering previously proprietary information
to help other companies seeking to make meaningful
progress toward net-zero carbon emissions. Learn more
about how we are engaging suppliers
Indirect emissions from other sources, which made up
74% of our total carbon footprint in 2024, increased
6% from 2023, primarily from data center construction
and fuel consumption by third-party delivery service
providers. As we look forward, we will continue to focus
on our supplier engagement programs and our investment
in lower-carbon building materials, which help create
scalable solutions for reducing indirect emissions across
our business.

Engaging Others on the Path to Net-Zero
Carbon by 2040
We recognize that addressing complex sustainability
challenges—like enabling widespread electrification,
scaling lower-carbon fuels, and increasing the availability
of lower-carbon building materials—requires growing

Enhancing Routing and Fleet Efficiency
Optimal routing and transportation network efficiency is
one of our most impactful ways of reducing emissions. To
optimize routing and transportation network efficiency,
we deploy a multi-pronged strategy to reduce emissions
during the full journey of an Amazon package from its
manufacturer all the way through to the customer. We
prioritize the lowest-emission delivery methods wherever
possible, while balancing trade-offs in speed, cost,
reliability, and convenience.
Where possible, we prioritize lower-emission transportation
options, using a mix of road, rail, sea, and air. In 2024,
we offered our customers shipping options that promote
routing efficiency, further reducing the miles traveled and
the average carbon emissions associated with delivery.
In 2024, Prime members in the U.S. saved an estimated
452 million deliveries due to consolidating their Prime
deliveries, which helped avoid the use of more than 494
million boxes and 335,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (MTCO₂e). Ocean and rail transportation have
a lower carbon footprint than air transportation, so we
prioritize shipping our products via those modes, when
feasible. In 2024, 90% of our imported transoceanic
shipments were transported via ocean freight and 10%
transported via airfreight, consistent with 2023. We
increased our total rail load volume by 59% in Europe and
11% in the U.S. compared to 2023.
Amazon launched rail deliveries in the UK for the first
time in 2024. Products are loaded onto train cars on the
fully electric West Coast Main Line, which runs between
Scotland and the Midlands. More than 5 million products
are expected to travel on the UK’s electric rail network
in 2025, avoiding traffic congestion and reducing carbon
emissions, with plans to expand across further electric rail
routes before the end of 2025.
We are also exploring using inland waterways and
passenger trains as part of our Intermodal City Injections
program. For example, we collaborated on a pilot project to

deliver packages using electric delivery vehicles to transport
products from the distribution center to an electric tram
followed by micromobility e-cargo bikes in Frankfurt,
Germany—achieving zero tailpipe emissions from delivery
station to customer. We have also continued to invest
in lower-carbon fuels and deployment of electric and
alternative fuel vehicles to reduce transportationrelated emissions.
We aim to avoid unnecessary delivery packaging whenever
possible, and select lighter, right-sized options, to ship
products to customers with fewer associated emissions.
We also aim to increase pack and fill rates to optimize
truck and airplane space, which can also reduce the
number of trucks needed to make deliveries. In addition,
we provide customers with shipping options that
reduce the emissions associated with the delivery of
their packages.

Implementing Efficiency Initiatives in Our Buildings
Building construction is a significant driver of carbon
emissions in many industries, due to the associated
embodied carbon that is emitted during the construction
process. Amazon’s buildings portfolio includes owned and
leased facilities in 65 countries, encompassing a number
of building types—including operations facilities, grocery
stores, corporate offices, and data centers. As a result,
implementing and scaling decarbonization solutions
and processes to reduce the footprint of our built
environment is a priority for Amazon.
Our building decarbonization work focuses on the
materials and methods used in construction as well
as the energy consumption and emissions associated
with operations that occur throughout a building’s
lifecycle. Our standardized approach targets five areas:
(1) prioritizing carbon-free energy; (2) increasing energy
efficiency; (3) using lower-carbon refrigerants; (4) using

Employee Experience

Health and Safety

Inclusive Experiences

lower-carbon construction materials; and (5) reducing
on-site water consumption and waste generation. These
efforts are supported by investments in innovative
technology, as well as regular testing and learning to
refine our approach and guide future development.
In 2024, we conducted 200 energy audits of our
existing buildings to inform future upgrade programs
and to help optimize operational performance. We
also improved energy efficiency in our North America
and Europe fulfillment centers through optimizing
warehouse ventilation controls, updating heating
and air conditioning scheduling, upgrading dock door
levelers, and implementing intelligent materials handling
equipment management. These system optimizations
helped reduce energy consumption by 92 million
kilowatt hours and helped avoid 24 million metric tons
of CO₂e compared to 2023. We piloted a prototype of
a new high-performance dehumidification technology,
which decreases air conditioning energy consumption
and associated emissions while improving air quality for
occupants in buildings located in humid climates.
As we progress our building decarbonization efforts,
we continue to obtain validation of our improvements
through Zero Carbon certification by the International
Living Future Institute (Living Future). In 2024, a sortation
center in Melbourne, Australia, was certified, bringing our
total Living Future-certified buildings to four.

Optimizing AWS Global Cloud Infrastructure
As the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted
cloud, AWS is committed to building a more energy
efficient and lower-carbon business for our customers
and the planet, especially as advancements in digital
transformation and adoption of advanced technologies
such as AI increase global demand for data center
capacity. Research estimates AWS infrastructure is up
to 4.1 times more efficient than on-premises computing,
and when workloads are optimized on AWS, the
associated carbon footprint can be reduced by up to 99%.

Community Impact

Responsible Business Practices

In 2024, AWS had a global PUE of 1.15. This was achieved
through optimized data center designs, purpose-built
chips, and innovative cooling technologies. Additionally,
in 2024, we unveiled new AWS data center components,
offering 12% more compute power with improved
availability and efficiency. AWS also introduced a novel,
direct-to-chip liquid cooling solution for high-density
AI compute chips in new and existing data centers. These
components reduce mechanical energy consumption
by up to 46% during peak cooling—without increasing
water usage.
Additionally, with increased computing power required for
AI and other applications, investing in purpose-built chips
that advance innovations in power efficiency continues to
be an important part of our strategy. We offer a number
of chips with energy-efficiency benefits. For example,
Graviton-based instances use up to 60% less energy than
comparable instances for the same performance. At the
end of 2024, over 70,000 customers had adopted Graviton
chips, achieving an estimated reduction of 12,000 MTCO₂e
due to increased energy efficiency. Amazon’s own adoption
of Graviton chips has achieved an estimated reduction of
71,000 MTCO₂e in 2024. Other efficiency savings include
Inferentia2-based instances, which offer up to 50% better
performance/watt over comparable Amazon Elastic
Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, and AWS Trainium3 chips
are designed to be up to 40% more energy efficient than
AWS Trainium2 chips.

Selecting Lower-Carbon Alternatives
Whenever possible, Amazon aims to select lower-carbon
alternatives across transportation, buildings, and products,
and we consider a range of factors, including cost,
emissions reduction potential, and availability.

Scaling Use of Electric Vehicles

network to minimize unnecessary transportation, promoting
electrification where technologically and operationally
feasible, and pursuing efficient lower-carbon fuel solutions.
We deliver packages to our customers every day,
making vehicle electrification within our network a
decarbonization priority for Amazon. We have set goals
to have at least 100,000 electric delivery vans on the road
globally by 2030 and more than 10,000 electric delivery
vehicles deployed in India by 2025.
In 2024, we made progress toward these goals, with more
than 31,400 electric vans deployed globally—including
more than 24,000 from Rivian—up from 19,000 in 2023.
To support this growth, we installed 11,770 chargers,
bringing our total to 24,000 chargers at 50 delivery
stations—now the largest private charging network in the
U.S. We also achieved our India goal ahead of schedule,
deploying more than 10,000 electric vehicles in 2024, a
year earlier than planned. These initiatives enabled us to
deliver 1.5 billion packages via EVs globally in 2024.
We continue to increase the usage of EVs that move
shipments between Amazon facilities, which are called
middle mile EVs and include light, medium, and
heavy-duty electric goods vehicles (eHGVs). In early
2025, we announced our largest order of zero-tailpipeemission heavy goods vehicles , with more than 200
new Mercedes-Benz Trucks eActros 600 vehicles set to
join our transportation network in Europe, which are
expected to transport 338 million packages per year once
fully operational. We expect these vehicles to join the 300
middle mile EVs deployed in our transportation network
by the end of 2025 in the UK and by 2026 in Germany. We
collaborate with others to advance the improvements in
charging infrastructure and electricity grids required to
enable more widespread use of eHGVs.
We are also focused on electrification of vehicles used
on-site. In 2024, Amazon had 360 electric yard hostlers,
vehicles that move truck trailers around fulfillment centers,
in North America—one of the world’s largest fleets.

Biodiversity

Responsible Supply Chain

Sustainable Products

While we aim to scale up our use of EVs globally,
electrification at scale is a challenge. Our operations
look very different across the globe, and within our
transportation networks, we see different vehicle
types from different suppliers. We need vehicles and
chargers that can meet our operational needs, as well
as our technical, cost, and sustainability requirements.
Specific challenges include limited land availability,
energy dependence, trade barriers, limited financing,
power availability at competitive rates, and unfavorable
policy environments. We are engaging with private and
government partners to remove these barriers and enable
broader access to electrification.

Sourcing Better Materials and Designing
More Efficient Products
We know that producing more sustainable and efficient
products starts with responsibly sourcing raw materials.
Agricultural deforestation is a significant contributor to
climate change, as it decreases carbon sequestration, thus
increasing GHG emissions. We aim to reduce deforestation
risk within our global grocery and commodities supply
chains for commodities including palm oil, beef, coffee,
and tea. When we develop Amazon devices, we aim
for each generation to be more carbon-efficient than
the last by integrating efficiency features directly into
product design and incorporating recycled materials into
our products where feasible. Learn more about how
we are reducing deforestation risk and designing moresustainable products

Increasing Use of Lower-Carbon Fuels and
Alternative-Fuel Vehicles
Electrification is our primary strategy for decarbonizing
logistics and transportation network vehicles. Where
electrification is not yet feasible, we are scaling and
encouraging the use of lower-carbon fuels, focusing
on road transportation in the short term and ocean
transportation and aviation over the long term. While
these fuels are important to our strategy, they remain

nascent, with industry challenges including supply
constraints, high prices, and limited access. We are making
investments to help lower costs and scale supply, and
through industry collaborations, we aim to encourage the
development and expansion of lower-carbon fuels, making
these fuels more accessible and affordable for everyone.
We engage in efforts that focus on:

diesel from fulfillment and sort centers in California
to Oregon and Washington. Amazon India Operations
entered into a strategic partnership with Hindustan
Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) to push the
development and adoption of Low Carbon Fuels (LCFs)
produced from agricultural and agro-industrial waste,
with the goal of decarbonizing long-haul transportation
in India. We also transitioned AWS backup generators
to renewable diesel in parts of Europe and the U.S. and
piloted this fuel at our Amazon Air Hub in Cincinnati/
Northern Kentucky in ground support equipment.

• Lower-carbon marine fuels: As a member of the First
Movers Coalition and co-founder of ZEMBA in 2023,
we seek to expand the use of lower-emission fuels and
technologies for ocean transportation. We support the
First Movers Coalition goal of using maritime ships with
zero-emission fuels for at least 10% of cargo shipped
internationally by 2030, and ZEMBA’s goal that freight
buyers can purchase third-party verified zero-emission
shipping for 100% of ocean cargo by 2040. In 2024, we
purchased lower-emission biofuel services representing
the maritime transportation of more than 10% of our
ocean cargo. In addition, Amazon worked with dozens
of companies to support ZEMBA’s first tender for ocean
shipping by committing to purchase Environmental
Attribute Certificates (EACs) associated with over
1 billion 20-foot shipping container-miles.

• Hydrogen: Hydrogen fuel vehicles are a promising
alternative to other fuels, as they produce water vapor
instead of carbon emissions when combusted. In
2024, we used 17,800 hydrogen-powered forklifts at
more than 80 fulfillment centers in North America. In
Japan and Europe, we began testing fuel-cell trucks
to evaluate their operational efficiency compared to
traditional diesel trucks.

• Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): For air transportation,
we source lower-carbon SAF and support the
development of SAF EACs. We work with peers on
innovative solutions to resolve the low volume and high
cost of SAF. We co-founded the Sustainable Aviation
Buyers Alliance and played a significant role in the
launch of the (SAFc) Registry, which aims to increase
transparency related to emissions reduction claims and
accelerate overall SAF deployment. In 2024, Amazon
procured 3.7 million gallons of blended SAF.

Utilizing Micromobility Solutions

• Renewable diesel: In 2024, we increased use of
renewable diesel—a lower-carbon fuel made from
waste fats and oils—and used 4.7 million gallons in
middle and last mile operations, up from 286,300
gallons in 2023. We also expanded use of renewable

• Renewable Natural Gas (RNG): In our transportation
network, we have compressed natural gas vehicles
(CNGs), which can reduce carbon emissions by at least
75% compared to diesel when refueled with RNG.14 In
2024, there were more than 4,400 CNGs on the road
in our transportation network—an increase of 12%
compared to 2023—which used 39 million gallons
of RNG.

We are working to scale micromobility solutions—
such as e-cargo bikes and on-foot deliveries—in our
transportation network to bring packages to customers
in more sustainable ways. In 2024, 170 million packages
were delivered via micromobility solutions globally, up
from 125 million packages in 2023.
In 2024, Amazon had 70 micromobility hubs—smaller,
centrally located delivery stations in dense cities—in more

than 45 cities across Europe and in New York City in the
U.S. We added micromobility hubs in London and Norwich
in the UK, Paris in France, Naples and Florence in Italy,
Barcelona and Santander in Spain, Berlin and Hamburg
in Germany, and Belfast in Northern Ireland. In the U.S.,
we continued on-foot deliveries in Manhattan, New York
City. Amazon also started piloting a new model of e-cargo
delivery bike in Brooklyn, New York , in November 2024
that can carry up to 120 packages per trip.

Reducing Embodied Carbon in Our Buildings
We collaborate within the industries we operate to
address embodied carbon emissions—the emissions
generated from the manufacture, transportation,
installation, maintenance, and disposal of building
materials. By helping to advance innovative, scalable
solutions, we aim to reduce embodied carbon emissions,
which are part of our Scope 3 footprint.
We use lower-carbon building materials across our
buildings portfolio where possible. In 2024, 49 building
projects across Amazon, including data centers, grocery
stores, fulfillment centers, and corporate offices, were
constructed with lower-carbon building materials and
finishes. These projects avoided at least 77,000 metric
tons of embodied CO₂e in 2024.
• Lower-carbon steel: In 2024, Amazon joined the
Sustainable Steel Buyers Platform , a coalition
of leading corporations working to accelerate the
availability of lower-carbon steel in North America,
in particular lower-carbon iron making technologies.
AWS constructed 36 data centers with lower-carbon
steel in 2024, in addition to 31 in 2023. AWS also
achieved an industry first by purchasing steel made
using hydrogen direct reduction from SSAB, a Swedish
steel company, and using it in one data center’s facade.
Hydrogen direct reduction is a key technology that could
help decarbonize the 76.3% of global steel production
that uses iron ore.15

• Lower-carbon concrete: We piloted lower-carbon
concrete solutions with a number of manufacturers
in 2024 to explore the use of calcined clay, natural
pozzolans, as well as cement containing less than 25%
clinker—a key concrete ingredient that accounts for a
substantial portion of its embodied carbon emissions.16
AWS used 9,600 cubic yards of less than 25% clinker
concrete at a data center in South Bend, Indiana, in the
U.S. This resulted in 1,500 tons of CO₂e avoided, which
is a 60% reduction against a 2021 baseline. In March
2025, this work was recognized as “Slag Cement Project
of the Year” by the Slag Cement Association, and
won a “Concrete Innovations” award from the National
Ready Mixed Concrete Association. We also used lowercarbon concrete developed by CarbonCure Technologies,
which we invested in through our Climate Pledge Fund,
in 46 Amazon building sites in 2024.17 To date, we have
used CarbonCure in 86 building sites. We continued to
promote the use of lower-carbon concrete across our
industry by working with the Center for Green Market
Activation and RMI toward a proposed book-andclaim system for concrete to accelerate demand-side
initiatives. In January 2024, AWS updated its design
standards to require the use of concrete with 35% less
embodied carbon than the industry average in new data
centers around the world. In 2024, 38 data centers were
constructed with lower-carbon concrete, in addition to
36 data centers in 2023.
• Mass timber: In 2024, we developed Mass Timber
Sourcing Guidelines to inform our building materials
suppliers and building partners about sourcing and
deploying lower-carbon structural wood. In 2024, eight
Amazon buildings integrated mass timber structural
elements in design or construction. We are leveraging
our learnings from these first mass timber projects and
exploring additional mass timber opportunities across
our operations and data center building portfolios.

We continue to track and report the embodied carbon
of our building construction materials by using the
Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator , and we
ask our key building contractors to do the same. In 2024,
Amazon collaborated with the UK Chartered Institution
of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) and Introba to
publish Technical Memorandum 65.3 (TM65.3) outlining
embodied carbon baselining guidance for the design,
construction, operation, and/or maintenance of logistics
centers in Europe. Additionally, Amazon worked with
the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and AirConditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) to adapt Technical
Memorandum 65 for North American building construction
and helped publish the TM65NA .

Implementing Lower-Carbon Approaches
to Heating and Cooling
We strive to use lower-carbon options for heating and
cooling of buildings to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
For example, we are switching more buildings to all-electric
heat pump rooftop units (RTUs), which are more efficient
than and eliminate on-site combustion. In 2024, we took
part in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Buildings
Commercial Building Heat Pump Accelerator, which aims to
drive the development and adoption of the next generation
of heat pump packaged RTUs by 2027.
By the end of 2024, 24 Whole Foods Market stores were
relying on natural refrigerants in a primary refrigeration
system. Natural refrigerants refer to refrigerants such as
ammonia, carbon dioxide, or propane, which are widely
considered the most sustainable alternatives to HFC
refrigerants. An additional 20 stores rely on a combination
of natural refrigerants and other refrigerants in a primary
refrigeration system. Where possible, we pushed to
integrate as much natural refrigerant as possible.

Transitioning to Carbon-Free Energy
As the energy needs of our business and customers
continue to grow, we are continuing to invest in
renewables and new sources of carbon-free energy that
can both help power our operations and bring new sources
of energy to the grid. Our energy portfolio includes
renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, as well
as nuclear power, which can be brought online at scale,
and has a decades-long record of providing a reliable
source of safe, carbon-free energy for communities
around the world. We are also expanding battery energy
storage capacity to collect and store renewable energy to
use when other energy sources may be unavailable—such
as at night or during periods of high demand—and to help
improve grid stability.
We recognize that making the transition to carbon-free
energy will require embracing and advancing a range
of technologies and innovations—there is not a
one-size-fits-all approach. We need to consider all viable
and scalable solutions. In addition to lowering emissions,
the transition to carbon-free energy can create real
economic growth in communities where energy projects
are built and operate, while encouraging the modernization
and better management of energy infrastructure. Learn
more about our global renewable energy projects and
our Renewable Energy Methodology

Solar and Wind Projects
Our approach to expanding our renewable energy
footprint includes robust investment in utility-scale wind
and solar projects. We have a strong track record of
enabling utility-scale renewable energy projects, as one
of the first corporations to do so in India, Ireland, South
Africa, Japan, and Indonesia. In 2024, Amazon invested
in 302 utility-scale wind and solar projects globally,
including 76 newly operational ones, in 29 countries. As of
the end of 2024, we had announced 302 power purchase
agreements (PPA).

Carbon-Free Energy Highlights
• 100% of electricity consumed by Amazon was matched
with renewable energy sources in 2024, for the second
consecutive year
• Since 2020, Amazon has been the world’s largest
corporate purchaser of renewable energy annually
• World’s largest corporate buyer of offshore wind energy
in 2024, according to BloombergNEF
• 100% of energy used by active Echo, Fire TV, and Ring
devices worldwide was matched with operational wind
and solar capacity in 2024
• 621 total renewable energy projects announced globally
as of January 2025—including 124 new projects in
2024—representing 34 GW of carbon-free energy
capacity, which can produce 91,000 GW hours of
carbon-free electricity annually
• 219 solar projects and 83 wind farms, totaling 302
utility-scale wind and solar projects as of January 2025
• 319 on-site rooftop solar systems at our fulfillment
centers and stores as of January 2025

Amazon became the world’s largest corporate buyer
of offshore wind energy in 2024.18 One of the most
impactful ways we have done this is by enabling nearly 1.3
GW of carbon-free energy across five offshore wind farms
along the coasts of Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK.
Once each project becomes operational, they are expected
to produce 5.8 GW hours of carbon-free energy annually—
enough to power 1.6 million average European homes. In
total, Amazon has announced 52 new renewable energy
projects in Europe as of the end of January 2025, adding
2.5 GW of renewable energy capacity to grid in the region,
for a total renewable energy capacity of 9 GW.
In the U.S., we expanded our renewable energy footprint
through 37 new solar and wind projects, bringing the total

to 281 across 30 states. This included investing in projects
that combine renewable energy with agriculture to bring
economic benefits to farmers. We are collaborating with
the renewable energy developer AES to use Maximo, an
AI-powered robot, to support building Amazon-enabled
solar farms , while enhancing safety and precision.

Delta Wind, a utility-scale wind farm along the Mississippi
Delta, is expected to bring a total of 834 MW of new
carbon-free energy to Mississippi, the equivalent of
powering over 200,000 U.S. homes.

Across the Asia-Pacific region, Amazon has invested in
97 renewable energy projects, including 53 in India. In
Japan, Amazon announced our first onshore wind farm
and stand-alone utility-scale solar project—a 33 megawatt
(MW) wind project located in Rokkasho, Aomori Prefecture,
as well as a 9.5 MW solar farm located in Kudamatsu,
Yamaguchi Prefecture. Amazon is the largest corporate
purchaser of renewable energy in Japan, with a total of
25 projects at the end of 2024.

We invest in energy storage to collect and store renewable
energy for use when other energy sources may be
unavailable—such as at night or during periods of high
demand—and to enhance grid stability. By the end of
2024, Amazon had eight solar energy projects paired with
battery energy storage systems, representing 2.1 GW
of capacity, up from 1.9 GW in 2023. In 2024, Amazon
powered nearly 4,000 hours of our operations from
energy stored in these batteries.

At the end of 2024, Amazon had 319 rooftop solar
projects at our fulfillment centers, sortation centers, and
stores around the globe. These projects avoid roughly
19.3 million metric tons of CO₂e each year. We brought
51 new on-site rooftop solar energy systems online in
2024, for a total capacity of 61 MW. These on-site rooftop
solar energy systems are estimated to generate 45 GWh
annually and avoid the equivalent of nearly 17,000 metric
tons of CO₂e annually.

In 2024, Amazon invested in the Baldy Mesa battery
storage system , which is monitored through machine
learning powered by AWS and is used to predict when and
how the project’s battery unit should charge and discharge
energy back to the grid, optimizing its performance. We
signed the first European Union (EU) Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) PPA that includes a 4 MW rooftop
solar photovoltaic system paired with a BESS in Spain. This
BESS initiative is expected to yield nearly 500 metric tons
of CO₂e avoided annually and enhanced energy resilience.

Data Center Electricity Use Matched by
Renewable Energy
In 2024, we continued to match 100% of electricity
consumed in all data center regions with renewable
energy sources and worked with utilities and regulators on
green tariffs so that more companies can buy carbon-free
energy directly from renewable energy projects. In 2024,
as part of a $10 billion investment for building two new
data center complexes in Mississippi, AWS announced
a first-of-its-kind agreement with utility company
Entergy Mississippi to enable 650 MW of new renewable
energy projects in the state over the next three years.
This investment, along with Amazon’s prior investment in

Nuclear Energy Sources
Nuclear power is an important part of our carbon-free
energy strategy, as it can be brought online at scale and
has a decades-long record of providing reliable, safe, and
abundant carbon-free energy for communities globally.
In 2024, we signed agreements to support the
development of nuclear energy projects, including
enabling the development of Small Modular Reactors
(SMRs)—advanced nuclear reactors with a small physical
footprint. This smaller size allows them to be built closer
to the grid, with faster build times, allowing them to
come online sooner than traditional reactors. Through

the Climate Pledge Fund, Amazon led an approximately
$500 million Series C-1 financing round in X-energy to
support nuclear technology development. X-energy is
targeting deployment of up to 960 MW of carbon-free
energy to the U.S. grid by 2039—which would be the
largest SMR implementation in the industry. X-energy’s
Xe-100 SMR technology delivers scalable, cost-effective
carbon-free energy generation for high-demand industrial
customers and aims to establish a commercial framework
for advanced nuclear energy deployment in the private
sector. We also began working with Energy Northwest on
a project to develop SMRs.
We complement this work by seeking opportunities to
support existing nuclear operations. We have signed
an agreement to build a data center facility near Talen
Energy’s nuclear facility in Pennsylvania, which will help
power our operations with carbon-free energy.

Engaging With Suppliers
Working with suppliers to help them reduce emissions is
critical to addressing climate change. We’ve identified our
high-emitting suppliers, which represent 50% of our
Scope 3 emissions, and mobilized our business units
to drive key supplier decarbonization actions—such as
setting credible targets, measuring and sharing progress,
and actively reducing emissions. These suppliers are in a
number of industries including transportation, building
construction, IT hardware and devices, as well as products
and packaging.
We recognized the need for practical tools to accelerate
implementation and to help support Amazon’s suppliers
and value chain partners in their own decarbonization
efforts. That’s why in July 2024, we launched the
Sustainability Exchange . The Exchange is a free resource
hub designed to help organizations of all sizes advance
their sustainability initiatives. Through the Exchange,
Amazon is publicly sharing playbooks, case studies, tools,

Accelerating Decarbonization
beyond Our Own Business
Catalyzing Industry Action and Innovation
through The Climate Pledge
The Climate Pledge
The Climate Pledge, which we co-founded in 2019,
is a commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions
across our global operations by 2040. It brings together

Laneshift , a public-private initiative under The Climate
Pledge, was launched in 2023 with C40 Cities through a
$10 million investment. This initiative aims to accelerate
the transition to zero-tailpipe-emission electric trucks and
charging infrastructure across cities in India, Brazil, and
Mexico—and help decarbonize the road freight industry,
which currently accounts for 5% of global emissions. 20
In 2024, Laneshift-Latin America worked with the
International Finance Corporation on market sounding
and with regional multilateral development banks to
accelerate deals in the EV freight sector. Also, LaneshiftIndia launched a 370 km EV freight corridor project
between Bengaluru and Chennai, marking the first step
toward a network of connected EV freight highways in
India. Electrifying the trucking sector in India is essential,
since trucking represents 3% of vehicles on India’s roads

but is responsible for 34% of CO₂ tailpipe emissions.
Laneshift-India expects to use the data from six months
of route testing to create an EV freight roadmap business
case, in an effort to reduce tailpipe emissions in the region.
The Climate Pledge joined with the Center for Green
Market Activation and RMI in 2024 to launch a new
lower-carbon concrete buyers alliance. 21 The alliance aims
to use a book-and-claim system to decouple the physical
product from its environmental attributes, allowing
companies to claim those benefits in advance of delivery.
In 2024, nine signatories, along with several industry
partners, committed to co-design the alliance, which aims
to send demand signals to concrete producers to adopt
new technologies for companies to procure lower-carbon
concrete at scale. 22
The Climate Pledge announced project JOULE (Joint
Operations Unifying Last-Mile Electrification) in 2024,
aiming to build a network of electric vehicle (EV) charging
stations in Bengaluru, India. By 2030, all the electricity
used by the charging stations is expected to be matched
with renewable energy, amounting to an estimated
6.2 MW of renewable energy capacity. Over the same
timeframe, the project is expected to support 5,500 EVs
and spur an investment of $2.65 million into the sector.

Advancing Industry Decarbonization
To catalyze collective action on decarbonization, we share
the expertise and resources we have developed as part of
our own decarbonization efforts.
In 2024, we launched the Amazon Science Exchange ,
to address the critical technology gaps that impede
Amazon and our collaborators from meeting our
sustainability goals. Our current work focuses on
packaging materials, building materials, and alternative
fuels. Through our Amazon Science Exchange website,
we share science-based models to help others identify
the most promising technological solutions and guide
decision-making.

Through the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative
(ASDI) , we enhance access to data to accelerate
sustainability research, innovation, and collaboration by
reducing the cost and time required to acquire and analyze
high-value datasets. These datasets are from public and
private sectors, including those related to weather, climate,
water, agriculture, air quality, and more, empowering
organizations to drive real world sustainability progress.
One such example is OCEARCH , which shares its satellite
telemetry information about shark movements through
ASDI to advance global research on ocean health.
In addition, AWS’s Customer Carbon Footprint Tool
allows customers to track, measure, review, and forecast
the estimated carbon emissions generated from AWS
usage. The tool helps our customers monitor the estimated
carbon emissions generated by AWS resources across a
number of services, regions, and time periods, and this
transparency allows customers to identify areas of higher
emissions and implement targeted optimizations to
reduce their footprint.
We continued to advocate for updated carbon accounting
guidelines for the Greenhouse Gas Protocol as a
co-founder of the Emissions First Partnership, a coalition
committed to modernizing GHG accounting standards
for the power sector. This work aims to accelerate grid
decarbonization to mitigate the worst effects of climate
change by supporting high-impact energy projects and
driving investments in renewable energy, battery storage,
or other mitigation solutions. We have also contributed to
the Advanced and Indirect Mitigation Platform, a coalition
working to formalize accounting standards for
market-based emissions reductions.

adopting ready-to-scale solutions, investing in emerging
technologies, and through direct funding.
The Climate Pledge Fund , a $2 billion venture
investment program that specifically targets companies
operating in hard-to-abate sectors, is central to our
approach. The goal of The Climate Pledge Fund is to
support solutions that could accelerate and lower the
overall cost to decarbonize Amazon and the broader
economy. In 2024, The Climate Pledge Fund reached a
milestone of five years of investments, making 12
new and follow-on investments in multiple industry
sectors that affect climate change: transportation and
logistics; energy generation, storage, and utilization;
buildings; manufacturing and materials; the circular
economy; food and agriculture; carbon removal; and water.
This brings The Climate Pledge Fund’s total investment
portfolio to 32 companies. Recent investments include:
• Forum Mobility, which provides accessible
zero-tailpipe-emission trucking solutions for drayage in
California, including charging infrastructure and Class
8 zero-tailpipe-emission electric trucks. Forum Mobility
is developing a network of charging depots around
the Ports of Oakland, Los Angeles, and Long Beach
in California, and Seattle, and Tacoma in Washington
state, and along common trucking routes to warehouse
destinations. Forum Mobility also provided the charging
infrastructure for Amazon’s first electric heavy-duty
trucks in our ocean freight operations.
• Glacier, an AI and robotics company, uses AI-powered
robots to automate sorting recyclable materials and
collect real-time data on recycling streams for recycling
companies and consumer brands. Glacier also supports
Amazon in testing new biomaterials in applications
where we have more limited sustainability solutions,
such as some flexible plastics, and then recycling them.
• Subeca, a company that offers a simple and secure
device that uses wireless networks such as LoRaWAN and
Amazon Sidewalk to assist Amazon, AWS, and utilities

in gathering timely and reliable data to manage water
use without relying on traditional cellular or building
network infrastructure. As a result, users can more easily
monitor and control resources and detect water leaks.
By utilizing Subeca’s single-device ultrasonic smart water
meter, Amazon can improve the efficiency of its water
use and reduce water loss across its fulfillment centers,
grocery stores, offices, and data centers.
As part of The Climate Pledge Fund’s broader commitment
to invest $50 million in climate initiatives led by women,
we invested in three new female-founded and female-led
companies in 2024, one of which is Paebbl. Paebbl converts
CO₂ into carbon-storing building materials, transforming
the built environment into a carbon sink. Concrete is the
world’s second most used material, and Paebbl aims to
future-proof its global supply chain by locking carbon into
everyday structures. AWS intends to trial Paebbl’s material
in the construction of one of its European data centers.

Supporting Policies That Drive
Decarbonization
Public policy can accelerate the deployment of emerging
lower-carbon technologies necessary to achieve global
decarbonization. A stable regulatory environment
supports long-term progress. Our global public policy
team works with policymakers, multilateral organizations,
industry associations, coalitions, and other partners to
accelerate decarbonization by scaling lower-emission
fuels, advancing zero-tailpipe-emission vehicle
deployment and associated infrastructure, driving the
deployment of carbon-free energy, modernizing the grid,
accelerating lower-carbon technologies, advancing circular
economy policies, and more.
In 2024, we continued our advocacy for expanding the
deployment of carbon-free energy and creating pathways
for corporate procurement of carbon-free energy. We
collaborate with organizations such as CEBA, Asia Clean
Energy Coalition (ACEC) and RE-Source to encourage these

policy changes around the world. For example, we worked
with regulators in Indonesia and Thailand to pioneer
utility green tariffs. In Europe, we supported ambitious
carbon emission reduction targets for newly registered
heavy-duty vehicles to accelerate deployment of
zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles at scale. In the U.S., we
worked with the Low Carbon Fuels Coalition to continue
our support for low-carbon fuels. Further, we engaged
in joint action with organizations such as the Center for
Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), the Cambridge
Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL) Corporate
Leaders Groups in the UK (CLG UK) and Europe (CLG
Europe), and Japan Climate Leaders’ Partnership (JCPL)
to support innovation and decarbonization.

Carbon Neutralization
Amazon’s carbon neutralization efforts are currently
focused on three priorities: reducing deforestation,
advancing the removal of carbon from the atmosphere
with nature-based solutions, and scaling up carbon
removal technologies. Across these areas, Amazon is
using a range of strategies, including direct investment,
advance purchase agreements, coalition building, new
methodology development, and technological innovation,
to scale outcomes and advance carbon credit quality. 23
Our approach is detailed in our Carbon Neutralization
Methodology .

Reducing Deforestation
Tropical forests, which cover 45% of the world’s forested
areas, play a crucial role in regulating global climate
patterns, according to the International Panel on Climate
Change. 24 As a result, mobilizing financing to enable
countries to protect their tropical rainforests is a key
focus of our carbon neutralization and broader
biodiversity efforts.

Advancing the Removal of Carbon from the
Atmosphere with Nature-Based Solutions
Nature-based carbon removal projects involve the
extraction and retention of atmospheric CO₂ by natural
and managed ecosystems. When effectively implemented,
these projects can create benefits such as wildlife habitat,
promote biodiversity, improve water quality, and reduce
flood risk.
As part of an independent working group composed
of carbon market experts, scientists, and conservation
professionals, representatives from Amazon contributed
to the development of the ABACUS label. It identifies
credits that reflect a rigorous set of principles and
requirements for quantifying the climate benefits of
restoration projects. In 2024, the label was formally
approved and released by Verra, the mission-driven
nonprofit that serves as a leading standards-setter for
the voluntary carbon market.

Scaling Up Carbon Removal Technologies
Direct air capture (DAC), which chemically scrubs CO₂ from
the air and then stores it deep underground or uses it in
applications such as building materials and lower-carbon
fuels, is an important technology in the fight against
climate change. Amazon is accelerating and scaling the
development of DAC solutions by investing in and
committing to purchase carbon removal credits produced
by DAC technology.

Waste and
Circularity
Our Approach
Our waste hierarchy sets our guiding principles for
preventing, managing, and reducing waste. Amazon
has programs in place to optimize our inventory, reduce
food surplus, and source materials that help us prevent
waste from the start. Where possible, we look for ways
to reduce, reuse, recycle, or compost these materials.
When waste is unavoidable, our priority is to recycle it,
minimizing what is sent to landfill and incineration.
We work hard to make it easy for customers to discover
products they love. They usually do, but as with any
retailer, sometimes customers want to return something
that they purchased from us. When returns happen,
Amazon strives to give items a second life through resale,
donation, or recycling—in that order of priority. Returned
items undergo inspection to determine whether they
can be resold. We aim to donate items that cannot be
sold, but when they are not suitable for sale, resale, or
donation, often due to damage or expiration, we prioritize
their recycling.
We know that avoiding waste is an ongoing process
and that we cannot do it on our own. We engage with
suppliers to reduce waste related to our products, partner
with other organizations to scale efforts to transition to a
more circular economy, and work with local municipalities
to improve recycling infrastructure where we can.

Our Progress
Waste Prevention
We view waste as a defect, aiming to prevent it whenever
possible. We implement a variety of waste prevention
efforts across Amazon—from our retail sites and
grocery stores to our corporate offices, data centers, and
fulfillment centers. This includes a focus on improving
product handling to reduce damage and supporting
customers in setting up, using, and repairing the products
they buy. We also integrate circular practices to extend
the useful life of products and assets, and when products
are returned, we assess, grade, and repair them as needed
to be relisted, resold, or redistributed.

Preventing Product Waste in Our
Fulfillment Centers
When it comes to product inventory, Amazon prioritizes
waste prevention by enabling customers to make more
informed shopping decisions—which can reduce customer
returns—and lowering the number of products damaged
in handling. Specifically, our efforts include:
• Reducing overstock: Before removing overstock from
our inventory, we try to sell it at a discount on Amazon
Outlet . If we can’t, we return the inventory to vendors
or sell it to wholesalers to be offered on secondary
markets. In 2024, we sold 68 million retail sellers’ items
on Amazon Outlet.
• Reducing damage: We take proactive measures to
safeguard products from damage during transportation
and handling. In 2024, we reduced the percentage of
damaged items within Amazon’s operations by 29%
compared to 2023.
• Expanding our repair programs: When possible, we
send damaged products for repair to enable resale.

Preventing Food Waste in Grocery Stores and
Distribution Centers
Food waste represents lost natural resources and nutrition
and is a significant contributor of greenhouse gas
emissions. 27 That’s why Amazon has set a goal to reduce
food waste by 50% by 2030 across our U.S. and Europe
operations. We prioritize reducing surplus inventory, and
when that is not possible, we focus on donation to reduce
waste generated. In 2024, the equivalent of 81 million
meals were donated globally—60 million in the U.S. and
21 million in Europe. Any remaining food waste follows
the hierarchy and as much is diverted to organic waste
treatment as possible.
We continue to explore new ways of reducing food loss and
waste as we work toward our 2030 goal. To continue driving
progress at scale, Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market
became members of the U.S. Food Waste Pact , a joint
initiative between ReFED and World Wildlife Fund. In joining
this national agreement, we are accelerating progress
toward our goals under a proven framework. This year, we
actively contributed food waste data to ReFED for inclusion
in the U.S. Food Waste Pact’s “Progress In Reducing Food
Waste: A Data Report from the Pacific Coast Food Waste
Commitment and the U.S. Food Waste Pact” as part of
our commitment. This collaboration supports our ongoing

are expanding this service to Amazon Fresh locations in
the U.S. Additionally, we maintain strong relationships
with food charities across our grocery stores, fulfillment
centers, and other retail sites to support ongoing
donation programs for surplus food.
When food cannot be donated or offered to customers
at a discounted price at Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods
Market stores, we aim to divert it via organic waste
treatment programs, such as composting. In 2024, we
continued to implement and expand these efforts at 612
locations and diverted 108,300 tons of food waste.

Preventing Office and Operational Material
Waste in Buildings
To run our operations, we use operational materials and
equipment such as packaging to transport products
between fulfillment centers, pallets to move products
within fulfillment centers, office furniture, storage racks,
electronic equipment, and conveyor systems. We aim to
prevent the waste associated with these materials and
equipment through the following methods:
• Implementing circular design practices: We focus on
developing modular equipment and components that
enhance operational efficiency while extending the
useful life of assets. We use innovative design principles
to create versatile equipment that can be easily
repurposed for multiple uses, reducing material waste
and potential losses. This modular approach can also

enable easier maintenance, repairs, and adaptability for
different operational needs. This results in more resilient
infrastructure where components can be efficiently
reused, repaired, or reconfigured, rather than replaced.

components, AWS is also exploring ways that better
design can help extend the lifespan of hardware and
equipment, further scale repair and reuse, and increase
materials recovery at end of use.

• Reducing single-use items and materials: We take a
systematic approach to reducing single-use materials
across our operations. Cross-functional working groups
collaborate to identify replacement opportunities and
source more environmentally efficient, lower-waste
solutions that meet our operating requirements. We
also use a detailed waste stream analysis to evaluate
the environmental impact of single-use materials and
prioritize circular solutions. In 2024, we expanded the
use of universal plastic pallets and GoCarts (a reusable
cart system that replaces pallets and cardboard
containers) and avoided the use of 85 million wood
pallets. Across our corporate offices, we are increasingly
transitioning away from single-use cutlery, plates, and
cups and replacing them with reusable alternatives.

• Operate longer: AWS seeks to use equipment for as
long as operationally efficient. AWS prioritizes keeping
functional drives in use for as long as possible, avoiding
early retirement of healthy and working hard drives.
This helps AWS power fewer racks with optimized
performance, replace aging hardware, and save water
and energy. As a result, AWS only needs to send
broken drives for recycling, avoiding early retirement
of healthy and working hard drives on the same rack.
Since 2023, AWS has avoided the purchase of more
than 500,000 new hard drives, reducing the associated
carbon footprint, costs, and waste.

• Extending asset life through reuse and donations: We
have established programs and built tools to enable the
repurposing, donation, and responsible management
of unused assets across Amazon. These programs and
tools facilitate the storage, tracking, and transfer of idle
assets between Amazon sites, as well as coordination
with charities interested in items no longer used by
our teams. In 2024, we repurposed 310,000 assets and
materials from these programs.

Preventing Hardware and Server Waste in
Data Centers
In 2024, AWS enhanced its circular economy strategy,
which focuses on three core pillars:
• Design better: AWS unlocks its greatest potential for
circularity through better design practices—including
avoiding excess materials, enabling repair and reuse, and
integrating recycled content from the start. In addition
to using 30% recycled or bio-based plastics in server rack

• Recover more: AWS aims to continually improve repair,
reuse, and recycling practices to recover more value
from decommissioned assets. AWS uses Amazon’s
re:Cycle Reverse Logistics hubs to assess, repair, and
recirculate used equipment into inventory or sell it to
third parties for reuse. To drive circularity and increase
landfill diversion, AWS sends racks to these hubs for
secure decommissioning of the hardware in the racks
before recirculation into AWS inventory, resale into the
secondary market, or recycling. In 2024, 11.5 million
components were sold on the secondary market through
our re:Cycle Reverse Logistics hubs. Additionally, these
reverse logistics hubs have enabled AWS to source 16%
of spare parts from its own reuse inventory, abating
110,000 tons of carbon emissions by avoiding purchase
of new parts. In October 2024, Amazon announced an
expansion of the re:Cycle Ireland Hub to continue
scaling this program. In 2024, the facility also earned
UL Solutions’ highest Zero Waste certification (Platinum
level) by diverting 100% of processed equipment from
landfills, including 99% through reuse by AWS, resale
into the secondary market, or recycling, and 1% to
Thermal Processing with Energy Recovery.

How We Manage and
Prevent Waste
This hierarchy is an industry framework that guides
our approach to managing and preventing waste.
It moves from the most preferred option at the top
to the least preferred at the bottom. Materials in this
hierarchy may be recycled, reclaimed, or otherwise
reused in some way and thus, may not end up as
waste in landfills. We use this framework to better
manage our waste, pursuing opportunities that are
more preferred before moving down the hierarchy.

Biodiversity

Prevent
We improve product and packaging design,
inventory management, materials sourcing,
and resource use to help prevent waste
from the start.
Reduce
We pursue avenues such as increased product
durability and resale to reduce waste. We also
work to prevent waste generation by helping
customers make informed decisions, which
reduces product returns, and offer several
ways for them to support product circularity.
Reuse
We repair, repurpose, and donate
usable items where possible.

hazardous waste and medical waste, may be ineligible
for recovery pathways, due to risks to human health
and the environment.

Waste Diversion
When we are unable to prevent waste, we seek to divert
it to the highest recovery option available. In doing so,
we reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills and
incineration. Our retail operations cover our largest
materials footprint, with transportation and handling
materials (such as cardboard, plastic, pallets, racks, totes,
etc.) representing our main waste streams. Cardboard
and wood represent 65% of Amazon’s operational waste
footprint, and almost 100% is recycled.
We track our waste diversion rate to measure progress
in waste management efforts. This metric reflects waste
diverted from landfills and incineration through recycling,
composting, and other material recovery processes. In
2024, we achieved an 83% diversion rate, up from 82% in
2023 and 79% in 2022.
We also measure our landfill diversion rate, which
tracks materials diverted from landfill via recycling and
incineration with energy recovery. In 2024, our landfill
diversion rate was 85%, up from 84% in 2023 and 82%
in 2022.
Our progress is driven by four focus areas:
• Establishing on-site materials separation and
recovery programs: We offer comprehensive employee
training and clear sorting guidelines in an effort to
maximize waste separation potential. Our systems are
designed to separate and consolidate materials into their
respective collection locations to optimize pick up and
recycling by our service providers.
• Working with specialized waste service providers that
offer recycling and recovery solutions: We aim to select
service providers that prioritize recycling over landfill
and incineration, and we have established contractual
requirements for waste diversion and data reporting to
support our overall waste management objectives.

Community Impact

Responsible Business Practices

• Conducting frequent waste characterization audits:
We seek to enhance waste management through
comprehensive characterization programs on unknown/
mixed waste materials that limit recyclability. These
assessments provide crucial insights into waste streams
and inform priority areas for recycling improvements.
• Collaborating with service providers and industry
experts to scale innovative solutions:
− Hard-to-recycle materials: We actively work to
develop solutions for hard-to-recycle materials
through industry collaborations and innovative
pilots. In 2024, we collaborated with UPM Raflatac’s
RafCycle service to launch a recycling solution for
the paper backing from our adhesive labels used
throughout operations across our North American
fulfillment sites. It is also in place in several of our
European facilities. Implementing this solution
increased recycling of this material by 16% compared
to 2023. We plan to scale it further across our North
American operations in the future.
− Waste sortation: We engage with waste technology
companies developing artificial intelligence (AI) and
computer vision solutions to improve waste sortation
and avoid contamination of different waste streams,
which can block recycling efforts. One example is our
investment in the AI and robotics company Glacier
through The Climate Pledge Fund. In 2024, we
worked with Glacier to test its AI-enabled waste
sorting technology for contamination monitoring
in cardboard streams, to drive optimal recycling of
cardboard waste at Amazon fulfillment centers, and
the identification of newly developed bio-based
packaging materials, to enable future sortation of
these materials from mixed streams.

Packaging
Our Approach
Amazon delivers millions of packages every day, and we
prioritize getting orders into the hands of our customers
as quickly, safely, and with the least amount of packaging
possible. Using a science-based approach, we strive to
provide right-sized, recyclable, and scalable packaging
solutions that reduce waste.
Our packaging strategy is guided by ongoing learning and
innovation, and rooted in four pillars:
• Avoid: We avoid additional packaging whenever possible
by shipping products in their original packaging.
• Optimize: When we need to use supplemental
packaging, we prioritize lighter, right-sized options
and use artificial intelligence (AI) to identify additional
optimization opportunities.
• Transform: We prioritize materials that are household
recyclable and reduce single-use plastic packaging.
• Innovate: We work across the public and private
sectors to create and scale more sustainable packaging
solutions and improve recycling infrastructure globally.

Our Progress
Avoid
When it comes to packaging, we start with protecting
the product to ensure it arrives undamaged. From there,
we find ways to use less packaging, while prioritizing

household recyclable materials. Many products can
be shipped safely without protection from additional
Amazon delivery bags or boxes, which is the intention of
our Ships in Product Packaging program . Through this
program, we deliver eligible items in the manufacturers’
original packaging without supplemental Amazon delivery
packaging, allowing us to avoid unnecessary material use
and reduce the weight of deliveries.
For a product to qualify for Ships in Product Packaging,
it must first meet our standards for safety and customer
experience. We continually work to increase the number
of eligible products that can be shipped through this
program, including some of the most complex products to
transport—such as TVs, appliances, and furniture. In 2024,
12% of Amazon packages globally were shipped without
additional packaging, the same as for 2023. Since 2020,
over 6 billion shipments have been delivered with only their
original packaging and a shipping label in North America
and Europe. This progress reflects our continued efforts
to expand product eligibility through identifying new
qualifying products; collaborating with selling partners
to test and design new packaging; and implementing our
regionalization approach, which shortens delivery routes
and lessens the potential risk of damage, where possible.
In February 2024, we allowed Fulfillment by Amazon sellers
to self-enroll in Ships in Product Packaging program in
North America and Europe, in line with Amazon’s own
retail practices. This led to nearly 2 million new seller
products becoming certified to ship in their own product
packaging in North America and Europe through seller
engagement, machine learning, and product testing in
2024. In total, nearly 18 million unique products qualified
and were shipped to customers in 2024 in North America
and Europe.
As this program expands, we are creating incentives
in certain regions to shift to packageless delivery and
working with others to improve packaging. In 2024,
Amazon collaborated with leading brands including

Employee Experience

Nestlé, Unilever, and SC Johnson to advance sustainable
e-commerce packaging. These partnerships focused on
identifying opportunities to reduce packaging complexity
and eliminate unnecessary materials, supporting shared
goals around environmental responsibility and innovation.
In 2024, we partnered with SC Johnson to redesign its
Method body wash packaging to make it eligible for
the Ships in Product Packaging program. The redesign
reduced the number of packaging components from three
to one, eliminating secondary plastic packaging in the
process. The redesign also helped decrease the overall
packaging volume by 63%.

Optimize
We strive to keep our packaging lightweight and minimal
while ensuring deliveries reach customers undamaged.
Lighter, more flexible, and right-sized packaging reduces
delivery emissions per package by using less material
and taking up less space in delivery vehicles, which
enables us to make more deliveries with fewer trucks.
When possible, Amazon uses lightweight packaging by
prioritizing flexible paper bags and envelopes. In the U.S.
and Europe, these flexible options are up to 90% lighter
than similar-sized, rigid cardboard boxes, and since 2015,
we have avoided 4.2 million metric tons of packaging
materials in North America and Europe.
We collaborate with organizations throughout our value
chain to accelerate the creation of optimized packaging
solutions. For example, Amazon collaborated with Mondi ,
a leading innovator of more sustainable packaging and
paper products, to develop a fully paper-based, recyclable
mailer with a protective paper lining, which scaled across
our European operations in 2024. The newly designed
envelope provides an alternative to plastic-based bubble
wrap and can offer protection for a single product or
multiple items.

*Amazon has removed single-use plastic delivery packaging from its European distribution network.

Transform
Amazon is working to transform our delivery packaging
by reducing our use of single-use plastic packaging in
favor of household-recyclable alternatives. Our packaging
engineers have been researching and experimenting for
years to identify alternative packaging solutions that are
easier for customers to recycle at home. In finding and
applying these solutions, we can systematically reduce
our use of single-use plastic. In addition, we are further
supporting the circular economy by increasing the use of
post-consumer recycled content in our delivery packaging.
Through these efforts, we have avoided 152,062 metric
tons of single-use plastic globally since 2020. In 2024,
we reduced our total plastic packaging globally by
16.4%, from 88,698 metric tons in 2023 to 74,137 metric
tons in 2024. This progress stems from reductions in
single-use plastics products at our biggest fulfillment
sites, including the removal of 100% of plastic air
pillows from delivery packaging at all North American
fulfillment centers and an overall increase in our use of
paper packaging solutions. We also continue to retrofit
our automated packing machines to create
made-to-fit paper bags across fulfillment centers in the
U.S. and Europe. In North America in 2024, we avoided
134 million plastic bags, and 56% of fulfillment centers
in North America did not ship plastic delivery packaging.
As a result, we saw a significant year-over-year decrease
in the number of shipments that contained single-use
plastic delivery packaging in North America, from 65% of
shipments in 2023 to 37% in 2024.

Community Impact

Responsible Business Practices

We also consider localized, country-specific challenges
and how to solve them as part of our ongoing approach to
reduce the use of single-use plastics in favor of recyclable
materials. We are continuing to extend these efforts
to shipments from Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates.
Where we cannot yet eliminate single-use plastic, we are
working to increase the percentage of recycled content in
our plastic consumables.
We also work with suppliers to incorporate more
post-consumer materials in our paper-based packaging
suite. For example, we are working with several packaging
suppliers in North America and Europe that use 100%
recycled content. The rest of our paper is sourced based
on paper grade and performance needs, prioritizing local
sourcing where possible.

Increasing the Recyclability of
Device Packaging
Amazon’s strategy to optimize and increase the
recyclability of packaging extends to our products and
devices. We are committed to increasing our use of
recyclable device packaging and finding recyclable solutions
for items that require additional protection during shipping.

we collaborated with two startups focused on reusable
delivery packaging—Hipli and RE-ZIP —to trial their
innovative technologies with Amazon across Europe.

• Testing: In 2024, we began early-stage testing on
bio-based bags made from organic sources with Amazon
Fresh in Spain . These bio-based bags have the best
attributes of conventional plastic and paper, in that
they are easily recyclable, biodegradable, lightweight,
and have both water and oxygen barriers. Through this
testing, we confirmed that these bio-based bags can
be used for several harder-to-recycle, fossil fuel-based
plastic applications. We also collaborated with Novamont
to test a biopolymer derived from starch and vegetable
oils, called Mater-Bi.
• Sorting: We are engaging with Glacier to use the
company’s AI-powered robots for sorting recyclables.
This will help us determine if bio-based bags can be
identified in mixed-material waste streams.
• Recycling: We developed a novel recycling technology
in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy’s
BOTTLE Consortium that can break down both bio- and
fossil fuel-based materials with ester bonds, allowing us
to keep both in circulation. 30
We recognize the significant investments needed to fund
early-stage innovations, which is why we collaborate
with those developing lower-carbon and lower-waste
materials and improve recycling infrastructure around the
world. For example, Shorr Packaging joined The Climate
Pledge in 2024, the first of our cardboard suppliers to do
so, while the packaging material provider Pregis became
our first supplier to obtain Amazon-provided renewable
energy credits to support the decarbonization of its
converting operations.

Our Approach
Amazon aims to be a good water steward in every
way we operate, including cooling servers in data
centers, preparing food in grocery stores, and providing
sanitation for associates in our buildings. Climate
change, population growth, and economic development
are increasing global water demand and affecting
water availability in many regions of our operations. As
a result, responsible and efficient water management
is an important part of Amazon’s overall sustainability
strategy. Amazon has public commitments to return
more water to communities than we use in AWS direct
operations globally by 2030, and in the direct operations
of all Amazon facilities in India by 2027. To meet these
commitments and support a more resilient and
water-secure future, we are working to reduce our global
water footprint and prioritizing action to address water
scarcity, access, and quality in the most high-risk
regions of our operations. We drive progress through
the following strategies:
• Reduce: We increase our water use efficiency and
reduce local withdrawals by installing water-conserving
measures in buildings and tracking water use in real
time to help minimize water loss.
• Reuse: We strive to source water from more sustainable
sources, such as recycled and/or harvested rainwater, to
minimize demands on public water supplies.
• Replenish: We invest in water replenishment projects
that increase community water access, availability, and
quality by restoring watersheds and bringing clean
water, sanitation, and hygiene services to
water-stressed communities.

Water Positive in Data Centers
In 2022, AWS announced its commitment to being water
positive by 2030. To meet this goal, AWS is focused on
improving liters per kilowatt-hour (L/kWh) water use
effectiveness (WUE), using more sustainable sources, and
delivering water replenishment. In 2024, AWS was 53% of
the way toward meeting its water positive by 2030 goal,
up from 41% in 2023. Progress is calculated using AWS’s
Water Positive Methodology .

Reduce
Amazon is continually working to optimize water
consumption and reduce the amount of incoming water
we use. Within our direct operations, reduction efforts
focus on increasing operational efficiency and resilience
to limit water loss and enhance water conservation. We
improve water use efficiency across Amazon operations
by scaling real-time leak detection, innovative treatment
technologies, and water-conserving fixtures.

AWS Data Centers
Amazon seeks to minimize water use across our global
data centers. Within AWS, global teams deploy water
monitoring technology in data centers to determine where
they need to take action to maintain or improve WUE.
In 2024, AWS began implementing integrated liquid
cooling components to more efficiently manage
artificial intelligence (AI) workloads at new data centers.
These novel solutions combine air and liquid cooling
capabilities for both powerful AI chipsets and AWS’s
network switches and storage servers. This flexible design

and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, assuring water
savings of 28% and 53%, respectively, as compared to
certification baselines. We also reached 90% completion
of our effort to install low-flow aerators at logistics sites
in India, which is expected to save 4.6 million liters of
water annually.
Across our corporate office footprint, we work to reduce
indoor water use and design new buildings to comply
with low-flow design standards. In 2024, we assessed
7.5 million square feet of corporate office space in
water-stressed regions in Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, Spain,
South Africa, and the U.S. Based on this assessment,
we installed low-flow faucet aerators at 17 U.S. sites to
achieve water savings in line with our standards. We will
expand this retrofit program to our other locations in
water-stressed regions in 2025.

Reuse
In 2024, AWS had 24 data centers using recycled water
for cooling and is working to quadruple the number
of data centers using recycled water by 2030. AWS
has agreements with seven utilities, enabling more
than 4 billion liters of fresh water to be preserved for
community use. As of the end of 2024, five data centers
have operational rainwater capture systems in place, which
reduces our demand on community water resources and
reduces the adverse effects of stormwater runoff, which
is a leading source of water pollution globally.
In India, Amazon is using on-site sewage treatment plants
at 27 logistics sites to recycle greywater for toilet flushing
and irrigation, which is expected to save an estimated
279 million liters of water per year. We also have
rainwater harvesting systems at fulfillment centers in
Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. These facilities use

Replenish
AWS invests in water replenishment projects in the
communities where we operate. These projects improve
community water access, availability, and quality by
restoring watersheds and bringing clean water, sanitation,
and hygiene services to water-stressed communities.
By the end of 2024, Amazon had announced 23 water
replenishment projects globally. These projects are
expected to return more than 7 billion liters annually to
communities once completed. In 2024, these projects
returned 4.3 billion liters of water to communities.

Water.org Water & Climate Philanthropic Fund
In 2022, Amazon committed $10 million to help
Water.org launch the Water.org Water & Climate
Philanthropic Fund, which has a goal of deploying $1
billion to deliver climate-resilient water and sanitation
solutions to 100 million people worldwide. By the end
of 2024, Water.org’s investment arm, WaterEquity,
had raised nearly $460 million and reached 7.1 million
people. With Amazon’s support, Water.org also
empowered 1 million people in India with access to
safe water and sanitation solutions in 2023 and 2024.

We expanded water replenishment activities to Chile
and China in 2024, and funded additional projects in the
U.S. and Brazil. These projects included leveraging AI to
promote water savings through more responsible irrigation
practices, treating and filtering water through the creation
and restoration of wetlands, repairing ecosystems, and
improving flood management.
In late 2024, Amazon launched new water replenishment
projects as we work toward returning more water to
communities in India than we use by 2027. Working with
the environmental organization SayTrees, Amazon is
undertaking a comprehensive restoration of two
once-vital water sources transformed by urbanization and
erosion—Yamare Lake near Bengaluru and Sai Reddy Lake
near Hyderabad. The restoration will include removing
silt and sediment from the lake bottoms, restoring bund
formations (embankments used to reduce erosion), and
repairing inlet and outlet structures to enable proper
drainage and regulate water flow. These projects, which
are specifically focused on regions of highest water stress,
are expected to increase the combined water volume
capture potential of the two lakes by more than
571 million liters once completed.

Rainwater harvesting “pits” use rainwater to
recharge groundwater at one of Amazon’s fulfillment

Biodiversity
Our Approach
Biodiversity, which is defined as the variety of living
species on Earth and the habitats, ecosystems, and natural
processes that support them, is declining globally due
to land use change, direct exploitation, climate change,
pollution, and the proliferation of invasive species. Since
1970, global wildlife populations have dropped by an
average of 73%, signaling severe stress on the natural
systems that support life. 32 Amazon recognizes the critical
importance of biodiversity to the health of the planet,
communities, and our business.
Amazon’s approach to biodiversity follows a mitigation
hierarchy that prioritizes avoidance and reduction of
habitat loss above other actions. We are focusing on three
areas to help avoid and minimize land use change within
our own operations and enhance biodiversity beyond our
business activities:
• Commodities in our supply chain. We aim to reduce
deforestation and responsibly source agricultural
and mineral commodities for our own products and
delivery packaging.
• Buildings where we operate. We seek to avoid and
minimize biodiversity loss related to the siting,
construction, and operations of the buildings that
support our businesses. We are beginning to measure
habitat value at building sites and develop design
standards that prioritize biodiversity enhancement.
• Beyond our value chain. We contribute to nature
conservation and restoration through collaborative
investments between private and public entities,

especially in regions with sensitive ecosystems. This
includes our commitment of $100 million to protect
and restore nature through the Right Now Climate
Fund. Amazon also enhances biodiversity through
broader sustainability initiatives. For example, we are
investing in nature-based climate solutions that reduce
and remove carbon from the atmosphere as part of
The Climate Pledge and in watershed replenishment
projects that protect and restore natural fresh water
sources to support our water positive goals.

Our Progress
Commodities in Our Supply Chain
The loss of natural habitat due to land conversion for
activities such as agriculture and forestry is one of the
primary drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide. Our
business activities can indirectly affect biodiversity
through the production of agricultural commodities
used in Amazon’s own-branded products and delivery
packaging. Our strategy to address this focuses on
measuring and seeking opportunities to reduce the land
footprint and the risk of habitat conversion from our
agricultural commodity supply chains.
One way we are minimizing impact is by continuing to make
progress on Amazon’s responsible sourcing commitments
and enhancing them over time. These commitments often
aim to achieve leading product certifications, such as those
provided by the Rainforest Alliance, Forest Stewardship
Council, and Better Cotton Initiative.
Within agricultural lands, Whole Foods Market works to
improve the farms it sources from through promoting and
supporting “climate-smart agriculture”—an approach to
farming that supports environmental health, including
the promotion of biodiversity, while considering both the
impact agriculture has on the climate and the climate’s

impact on agriculture. Whole Foods Market has a
long-standing commitment to organic and regenerative
agriculture, two approaches that employ climate-smart
strategies. In 2024, 34% of all products sold at Whole
Foods Market were organic, and over 61% of all fresh
produce sold in 2024 was organic. To further promote
on-farm biodiversity, Whole Foods Market joined Mad
Agriculture’s Wilding initiative in 2024. This effort
supports the strategic integration of native perennial
vegetation planted in and around agricultural fields
to enhance farm viability, protect pollinators, improve
soil health, and support water retention. Through this
partnership, Mad Agriculture and participating farmers
are planting and maintaining 113 acres of reconstructed
prairie, most of which are on farms that supply ingredients
to brands we sell, reflecting a shared commitment to
regenerative agriculture and environmental stewardship.
Whole Foods Market also supports pollinator health
through its industry-leading Quality Standards .
Under the Whole Foods Market Pollinator Health Policy
for Fresh Produce and Floral, all fresh produce and floral
suppliers must implement an integrated pest management
system, which reduces the need for chemical pesticides.
In recognition of its ongoing work, Whole Foods Market
was 2024’s top-ranked retailer on Friends of the Earth’s
Bee Friendly Retailer Scorecard, which ranks retailers on
pollinator protection from pesticides in food and beverage
supply chains.

Buildings Where We Operate
To address potential natural habitat changes associated
with buildings in our retail operations and data centers, we
are establishing metrics, guidance, and tools that support
best practices for preventing habitat loss and creating
on-site enhancements. At 24 building sites across Europe,
North America, and India, we are evaluating habitat
conditions and developing site designs that help avoid and

Human Rights
Our Approach
Amazon’s operations impact millions of people worldwide,
including employees, suppliers and their workers,
customers, and communities. With this reach, we can play
a critical role in respecting and promoting human rights.
We believe every individual deserves to have their
fundamental dignity respected. To achieve this, we embed
respect for human rights throughout our business activities,
and we work to engage with partners and suppliers that
align with our values.
Amazon is committed to respecting internationally
recognized human rights as defined by international
standards and frameworks developed by the United
Nations (UN) and the International Labour Organization
(ILO), including the UN Universal Declaration of Human
Rights ; the Core Conventions of the ILO ; and the
ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights
at Work .
Our approach

is built on five pillars:

• Developing and maintaining strong human rights
policies and standards
• Embedding human rights into our business activities
and decision-making
• Identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and addressing risk
• Engaging with stakeholders
• Improving access to effective grievance mechanisms
and remediation

Our Progress
We regularly strengthen our policies, programs, and
resources to help ensure that our employees and
workers everywhere we operate are treated with respect,
understand their rights, and feel empowered to speak
up. As outlined in more detail below, we continuously
evaluate our operations and value chain, engaging
stakeholders to identify, assess, prioritize, and address
salient human rights risks, specifically those related to
workers, customers, and people who live in communities
connected to our business.

Developing and Maintaining Strong
Policies and Standards
Amazon’s Global Human Rights Principles outline
our commitment to embed respect for human rights
throughout our business activities. We published an
update to our Global Human Rights Principles in January
2025 to better align with evolving business needs,
international standards, and industry best practices. In
addition, Amazon’s Supply Chain Standards outline our
expectations for suppliers.
In 2024, to mitigate human rights risks that may occur
during supplier disengagement, we adopted responsible
disengagement guidelines. We prioritize working with
suppliers to encourage remediation whenever possible,
using disengagement only as a last resort, because
terminating business relationships removes the incentive
for improvement and can negatively impact workers
and communities.

Embedding Human Rights
into Our Business Activities
and Decision-Making
Respect for human rights is everyone’s responsibility at
Amazon. We embed this responsibility into our policy and
governance framework and develop resources, guidance,
and tools to help implement Amazon’s human rights
strategy. We have a central team that works across the
company to conduct human rights due diligence and
integrate human rights considerations into business
decisions. In addition, we strive to embed our human rights
principles in employees’ everyday work by offering training
and resources to help drive accountability at all levels.
All employees have access to online training on the
company’s human rights commitments. We also offer
modern slavery training, available in seven languages,
which helps employees identify warning signs and report
concerns to the appropriate authorities, as well as training
on responsible purchasing practices for our sourcing and
procurement teams.

Assessing, Prioritizing,
and Addressing Risk
We continue to refine our approach to assess, prioritize, and
address human rights risks across our business activities.
Our teams work to understand risks, strengthen prevention
strategies, and integrate human rights and environmental
considerations into everyday business decisions.
In 2020, Amazon conducted an enterprise-wide human
rights saliency assessment to identify salient human rights
risks under international standards. 33 Since then, we
have conducted an increasing number of business-specific
due diligence assessments, including an Amazon Devices

a due diligence management systems review of Whole
Foods Market (2023).
In 2024, we expanded our human rights and environmental
due diligence (HREDD) work to encompass a broader range
of key businesses and enterprise segments, including 10
business units such as AWS, Operations, Stores, Grocery,
and Corporate Real Estate. Our methodology is grounded
in international standards and combines country, sector,
and product data with internal insights from worker
feedback, among other sources.
The results of these HREDD assessments strengthen our
understanding of systemic and business-specific risks
and inform action plans to mitigate future risks. In 2024,
we strengthened Amazon Private Brands’ responsible
sourcing practices by supporting suppliers in mitigating

chain improvements. Following Amazon Private Brands’
2023 Human Rights Saliency Assessment, we prioritized
areas such as chemicals management and fair wages,
conducting deep-dive assessments including a fair wage
benchmarking exercise across targeted sites in Bangladesh.
We also used supplier feedback collected through Better
Buying to improve sourcing and procurement strategies.

Engaging with Stakeholders
Addressing human rights challenges requires collaboration
with stakeholders and industry partners who share our
priorities. Our human rights due diligence strategy includes
stakeholder engagement to promote accountability and to
engage in collaborations.
We collaborate with credible and innovative organizations
to help improve working conditions across our supply
chain. For example, in 2024, Amazon:
• Supported the Japan Platform for Migrant Workers
toward Responsible and Inclusive Society (JP-MIRAI)
in launching a Fair and Ethical Recruitment Initiative.
This initiative aims to advance migrant worker rights
through stakeholder engagement and specialized
training programs in the Asia-Pacific region.
• Hosted and sponsored BSR’s third annual Tech Against
Trafficking Summit , bringing together 162 experts,
including individuals from technology companies,
governments, human rights nonprofits, and those with
lived experience, to explore technology-driven solutions
both for improving supply chain transparency on forced
labor and accelerating the efforts of local and global
anti-trafficking organizations.
• Facilitated discussions with multiple companies to
discuss ways to protect young workers and eliminate
child labor in American supply chains.

enable us to review and address suggestions, concerns,
and grievances.
Beyond our employees, we expect our suppliers to provide
their workers access to effective grievance mechanisms in
our supply chain . Amazon works with our suppliers to
help them develop these mechanisms and to support the
resolution of issues that are reported.
We also welcome anyone—including employees,
contractors, suppliers, customers and community
members—to share concerns directly with us through our

Our Approach
With a network of thousands of suppliers around the
world, we embrace our ability to support safe and healthy
working conditions throughout our supply chain. Our
dedicated supply chain engagement teams are focused
on building long-term relationships and fostering
ongoing improvement. We engage directly with suppliers
that support safe working conditions, fair pay, and
environmental protection in their own businesses. We
also collaborate with industry peers that maintain high
standards and drive progress through new initiatives.
Amazon’s Supply Chain Standards , available in 23
languages and dialects, detail our expectations for all
suppliers of goods and services for Amazon, including
service providers, vendors, selling partners, contractors,
and subcontractors. 34 Products sold in Amazon stores,
as well as products and services provided to us, must
be manufactured, produced, or provided in accordance
with these standards. Suppliers are responsible for
communicating these standards to their own suppliers.
In 2024, to promote awareness of the Supply Chain
Standards, we developed and deployed online trainings
to 500 suppliers, including a new course on child labor
prevention. Additionally, we made 38 third-party online
trainings covering 14 human rights topics—such as
anti-harassment and responsible recruitment—
accessible for our businesses to offer to their suppliers.
To complement our online training efforts and further

supply chain. All Whole Foods Market seafood suppliers—
from vessel owners to processors and distributors—are
expected to follow these standards. The Seafood Code of
Conduct builds on Whole Foods Market’s broader Supplier
Code of Conduct and is part of the company’s long-term
mission to promote social responsibility and continuous
improvement in its supply chain.

Our Progress
Assessing Our Suppliers
Our supplier assessment approach includes auditing
our suppliers, working with them when issues arise, and
managing supplier risk in Amazon-branded product
manufacturing and our global logistics network.

Audits
Supplier audits help us to assess supplier compliance with
our Supply Chain Standards, identify issues, and take
corrective actions when needed. 35 We audit suppliers in
four categories: Labor Rights, Ethics, Environment, and
Health and Safety.

Employee Experience

unethical behavior. A medium-level finding is an issue that
poses significant risk of harm to workers or communities
or demonstrates unethical or exploitative behavior. When
high-level issues are identified, suppliers must develop
corrective action plans to address identified issues as well
as long-term plans to prevent recurrence. As necessary,
suppliers must also undergo follow-up audits to confirm
the sufficient remediation of identified issues. For
medium-level issues, we track and confirm meaningful
progress toward resolution through corrective action
plans, while we monitor low-level issues for continuous
improvement through maintenance audits.

Risk Management
We seek to identify, assess, and prioritize risk across our
supply chain through a centralized methodology that
combines external data, worker feedback, and audit
findings aligning with international standards. This
central methodology allows us to more systematically
assess our supply chains to better understand the highest
risks to workers. Our approach includes identifying
country-specific risks and implementing site-level
requirements to build suppliers’ capacity to meet our
Supply Chain Standards. For example, in countries
identified as at the highest risk for modern slavery, we
require eligible suppliers to join Better Work, a program
that collaborates directly with factories, workers, and
their representatives to support greater compliance with
national labor laws and international labor standards. 36
In countries where Better Work is unavailable or not
applicable to a product category, we require participation
in an Amazon-managed audit and Amazon’s advisory
services, a tailored supplier-level intervention with
enhanced oversight to improve working conditions and
maintain continuous improvement.

Expanding Our Supplier Audit Program
In 2024, we strengthened our global human rights risk
management by expanding our supplier audit program to
reach more of Amazon’s global logistics network. While
our audits have traditionally focused on Amazon-branded
product suppliers, we recognize risks to workers exist
throughout our supply chain. By broadening our scope to
include third-party labor, service, and not-for-resale goods
providers in our logistics, warehousing, and construction
supply chain, we demonstrate our commitment to making
human rights risk mitigation central to our logistics
business strategy and daily decisions. Given the scale
and complexity of our global logistics supply chain, we
began by auditing suppliers operating within our facilities,
building upon our established processes and tools. Over
the next several years, we plan to expand these audits
to our global transportation supply chain, developing
approaches tailored to different businesses and supplier
categories, to enhance our assessment of third-party
service providers’ compliance with Amazon’s Supply
Chain Standards.
In 2024, we performed 3,639 audits of suppliers of
Amazon-branded products, third-party labor, service,
and not-for-resale goods providers in our logistics,
warehousing, and construction supply chain. Of these,
1,695 audits specifically focused on third-party labor,
service, and not-for-resale goods providers in our logistics,
warehousing, and construction supply chain. These include
initial audits with new suppliers to our audit program,
maintenance audits for sites we have already audited and
supported, and verification audits to confirm sufficient
remediation of identified issues.

result in suppliers losing their ability to conduct business
with Amazon. While the remediation varies based on the
nature and scope of the issues, we prioritize working with
suppliers to respond quickly, remove harm, act in the best
interests of workers, and commit to preventing similar
issues in the future.

to increase supply chain transparency and collaboration.
Amazon also serves on OS Hub’s Technical Steering
Committee, a multi-stakeholder group that supports the
technical direction and development of the hub.

Advancing Our Supply Chain
Commitments
To build a responsible supply chain, we focus where we
can have influence both directly and indirectly through our
work with industry and other partners .

Responsible Recruitment and Freely
Chosen Employment
We do not tolerate child labor, involuntary or forced
labor, human trafficking, or modern slavery in any form.
We continually work to improve our efforts to identify,
prevent, and address the risks of all forms of modern
slavery. We work to provide individuals from vulnerable
and marginalized communities access to clear, transparent
information on working conditions including pay, hiring
practices, and contract terms.
In 2024, Amazon strengthened our detection and
prevention capabilities; we established robust reporting
mechanisms and enhanced monitoring systems designed
to identify and address potential risk indicators quickly and
efficiently. Through our comprehensive awareness program,
we delivered specialized training to over 2,500 security
associates across our U.S. operations. In 2025, we plan to
expand this training globally. We also launched training on
identifying and preventing child labor in supply chains for
our grocery suppliers in 2024.

We engage and collaborate with relevant stakeholders—
including nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), law
enforcement and other agencies to reinforce and advance
our efforts to prevent risk. In 2024, we worked with the
Mekong Club, a nonprofit organization that partners with
the private sector to help prevent modern slavery. The
Mekong Club provided a training series on responsible
recruitment practices for 172 suppliers in Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates. As a corporate sponsor of
TAT (Truckers Against Trafficking), we support its mission
to educate, equip, empower, and mobilize members of
key industries and agencies to combat human trafficking.
Through TAT’s training modules, we have equipped 10,100
active Amazon transportation associates to identify and
respond to potential instances of human trafficking,
including 4,100 associates trained in 2024.
We continue to support a systems-change approach
through industry collaboration. In 2024, Amazon
announced participation in the Harvesting the Future
– Cotton in India initiative, a multisector collaboration
coordinated by the Fair Labor Association. This threeyear effort connects Amazon and 23 other global brands
with Indian garment and textile producers and several
local implementing partners to enhance working and
living conditions for cotton farmers and their families
across 32 villages in Madhya Pradesh, India. After a
comprehensive scoping study, the brand group focused
on specific efforts to create improvements in the cotton
sector, such as establishing child labor-free zones,
initiatives to help ensure legal wages, and monitoring of
working conditions. In 2024, we also collaborated with
The Centre for Child Rights and Business to conduct child
labor risk assessments for strategic suppliers in the U.S.,
develop risk management tools and training materials
that reached 344 suppliers, and engage with stakeholders
including business representatives, NGOs, and workers to
strengthen our child labor prevention framework.

Access to Effective Grievance Mechanisms
We encourage workers across our value chain to voice
their concerns, whether directly to us, through
supplier-managed tools, products, and systems that we
support, or by connecting our suppliers to third-party
grievance mechanisms.
For example, through our Worker Voice program, we
assist suppliers to improve their own internal systems,
conduct supplier and worker training, triage cases, and help
improve management of the grievance process. In 2024, we
developed a worker grievance tool for contracted associates
at Amazon facilities in Saudi Arabia so that worker voices
could be heard by both our suppliers and Amazon.
We also connected suppliers and service providers with
supplier-managed grievance mechanisms that we support
to hear directly from workers about their experiences and
support the resolution of issues from workers’ perspectives.
In 2024, we helped connect supplier sites in eight countries
with third-party grievance mechanisms. One example is
the Amader Kotha Helpline, which is a partner of Nirapon,
an industry-led nonprofit that works with global brands,
retailers, manufacturers, and other NGOs to create
and sustain a culture of workplace safety in factories in
Bangladesh. Another example is Ulula, a worker-centric
platform that enables workers to participate in surveys and
access a remedy-centered helpline to raise their concerns
with specialized support in Cambodia, China, India, and
Pakistan. In Japan, we partner with JP-MIRAI to provide
workers at certain supplier sites access to JP-MIRAI’s
independent grievance mechanism.
Our Human Rights and Environmental Complaints
Form allows supply chain workers, among others,
to share concerns directly with us. It is available in 19
languages and dialects and can be accessed globally.
Complaints are evaluated in accordance with Amazon’s

Safe and Healthy Workplaces
Everyone has a right to a safe and healthy workplace.
Across the globe, we work with suppliers and global
organizations to support workers’ rights to safe and
healthy workplaces. For example, our work with Nirapon
extends beyond grievance mechanisms to foster
workplace safety in Bangladesh through monitoring and
overall safety oversight and training.
We are also members of the Life and Building Safety
(LABS) Initiative, an industry-driven program which
works to mitigate preventable fire, electrical, and
structural building safety risks in key apparel-, footwear-,
accessories- and home-textile-producing countries.
Since 2024, Amazon has actively contributed to the
LABS program through participation on the Steering,
Technical, and Communications committees. In addition,
through our Building, Electrical, and Fire Safety (BEFS)
program, we go beyond traditional audits in countries
not covered by Nirapon or LABS. In 2024, Tier 1 supplier
sites in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Vietnam participated in safe and healthy
workplace industry programs including LABS (sites
nominated by peer brands), Nirapon, the ILO’s Sustaining
Competitive and Responsible Enterprises (SCORE), Social
Accountability International (SAI)’s TenSquared, and PATH

remains a global, cross-industry issue. Wage transparency
is critical to assist us in addressing wage disparities in our
supply chain, and we support our suppliers in evaluating
whether workers earn enough to meet their basic needs
and the needs of their families.
In 2024, Amazon Private Brands expanded its fair
wage benchmarking program to the apparel sector
for worker compensation at Tier 1 factories and Tier 2
mills in high-risk areas. In Bangladesh, the assessments
enabled suppliers to measure their progress toward fair
compensation, as we work closely with our suppliers to
support their implementation of Bangladesh’s updated
wage regulations.
We also supported the Anker Research Institute, a global
research initiative that has developed a methodology for
estimating living wages and living incomes around the
world. By annually updating its publicly available global
database of living wage and living income estimates,
all stakeholders can access information on the cost of
living in regions where products are manufactured or
harvested, so that they can make informed decisions,
support advocacy efforts, and contribute to the
promotion of decent wages and incomes. In 2025,
we plan to support key suppliers to assess worker
compensation and develop response plans, including
enhanced wage training and remediation support.

Environmental Protection
We strive to source products and services that avoid
unnecessary environmental harm. In 2024, we continued our
collaboration with the Institute of Public & Environmental
Affairs (IPE), a nonprofit environmental research organization
in China that promotes environmental disclosures and
environmental governance. We use IPE’s public database
to assist in screening our supplier sites in China for
environmental issues. In 2025, we plan to integrate IPE’s
data with other sources, including grievance mechanisms, to
strengthen our ability to identify potential environmental

Amazon also encourages suppliers to evaluate their
sustainability-focused practices using the Higg Facility
Environmental Module (FEM), which assesses performance
and helps prioritize opportunities for improvement
across seven environmental impact areas, such as carbon
emissions, waste, and water. In 2024, 61% of Amazon’s
Private Brands Tier 1 apparel suppliers completed the
Higg FEM, to better understand their environmental
performance and practices.

Equal Opportunity
Amazon serves on the advisory board of the Resilience
Fund for Women in Global Value Chains, supporting
women-led organizations in Southeast Asia through
flexible grants for sexual and reproductive health
programs or the prevention of gender-based violence.
In 2024, we completed the implementation of BSR’s
HERproject, a legacy program now part of RISE
(Reimagining Industry to Support Equality), to support
workers in Vietnam with health care training. Further, our
i4Equality training program covers gender inclusion and
the prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace, as
well as women’s health, workplace dialogue, and financial
literacy for suppliers in China, India, and Sri Lanka. By
the end of 2024, 5,800 female workers had completed
training in Sri Lanka.

Our Approach
Amazon’s commitment to our customers means offering
products that align with our customers’ values and
expectations. This includes providing customers with
opportunities to discover and purchase more sustainable
products. We work across our brands to embed
sustainability principles and focus on three themes:
• Sourcing better materials: We are improving our
materials and sourcing standards and continuing to
make progress on our sourcing goals for Amazon- and
Whole Foods Markets-branded products. 41 This entails
sourcing minerals, commodities, and agricultural
products responsibly; using safer chemicals; and
incorporating recycled materials where possible.
• Designing more sustainable products: We aim to
reduce the emissions and waste associated with the
design, development, and delivery of Amazon- and
Whole Foods Market-branded products.
• Providing more sustainable shopping choices: We
create and offer programs that enable our customers
to purchase more sustainable products—both Amazon
and non-Amazon products—across our various
channels. This includes Climate Pledge Friendly ,
through which customers can discover products that are
recognized to have at least one sustainability feature.

Sourcing Better Materials
Creating more sustainable products starts with sourcing
raw materials responsibly. We focus on improving the
materials and sourcing standards for our Amazon Private
Brands and Whole Foods Market products.

Materials and Agricultural
Commodities Sourcing
To support the elimination of deforestation linked to
raw materials and ingredients within our global grocery
and commodities supply chains, Amazon has made
commitments for the use of palm oil, paper and paper
packaging, beef, soy, cocoa, coffee, and tea. We have
also established goals and ambitions related to more
sustainable seafood, animal welfare, and apparel for our
Whole Foods Market and Amazon Private Brands in North
America and Europe.
In 2024, Whole Foods Market and Amazon Private
Brands achieved 22 of 38 sustainability commitments,
which cover 11 different commodities. Whole Foods
Market achieved 11 sourcing commitments, consistent
with progress achieved in 2023. Amazon Private Brands
North America and Europe achieved 12 out of 27 goals
and ambitions, including our paper sourcing goal for
100% of paper products in North America. We have
identified opportunities to hit 100% in Europe in 2025.
Amazon Private Brands North America also increased
the percentage of bagged tea products it sourced from
Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade International, or Fair Trade
USA-certified suppliers to 75% in 2024, up from 18%
in 2023.
Amazon remains committed to mitigating deforestation in

Europe partnered with a third-party consultant in 2023
to assess deforestation risks. Findings showed that most
soy used in North American Amazon and Whole Foods
Market private brand products comes from domestic
sources, presenting minimal deforestation risk. In Europe,
we made progress increasing the percentage of verified
Deforestation- and Conversion-Free soy in our European
supply chains throughout 2024. However, industry-wide
challenges mean we will likely not be able to achieve our
full commitment without change. To help drive industrywide change, Amazon Fresh Private Brands in Europe
has joined the Retail Soy Group, demonstrating our
ongoing commitment to making sustainable soy the
market standard.
Amazon became a member of the Roundtable on
Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2024, reinforcing our
commitment to source RSPO-certified palm oil in
our Private Brands products. As a result, we achieved
substantial progress on our goals to source palm oil and its
derivatives from sources certified to the RSPO supply chain
standard, reaching 100% in-scope products for Whole
Foods Market and 97% and 100% for Amazon Private
Brands North America and Europe, respectively.

Amazon Grocery
Amazon seeks to sell high-quality grocery products
made with responsibly sourced ingredients and ethical
production practices. At Whole Foods Market, our
rigorous Quality Standards ban many ingredients
commonly found in other stores, and numerous farming,
ranching, fishing, and manufacturing practices. Amazon
Fresh in North America is also one of a few grocery
retailers nationally that offers only cage-free egg
selection. Additionally, Amazon Private Brand shell and
liquid eggs must meet cage-free or higher animal welfare
standards, and all stand-alone coffee and teas must be
certified by the Rainforest Alliance, Fair Trade USA, or
Fairtrade International.
In 2024, we measured carbon emissions, soil health,
and water usage of Whole Foods Market and Amazon
Fresh private label food products. As of the end of 2024,
we had measured the carbon footprint of 69% of our
food-related private label products, which allows us to
identify and prioritize carbon abatement projects. Projects
implemented in 2024 include manure management with
dairy farmers, increasing climate smart practices on dairy
farms and with leafy green growers, and enhancing process
electrification and feed efficiency with seafood suppliers.
We also explore ways to improve grocery packaging
to lower associated emissions, reduce food waste, and
divert waste from landfills. Amazon Fresh Private Brands’
and Whole Foods Market’s packaging guidelines help
merchants, procurement teams, and suppliers to make
more sustainable packaging choices and reduce material
use. In 2024, our North America Grocery Private Brands
business avoided 8.85 metric tons of plastic.
In addition, Whole Foods Market is expanding its carbon
reduction efforts beyond stores to its supply chain and
working with suppliers to reduce the carbon impact
of products in its supply chain. In 2024, Whole Foods
Market launched a pilot program to reduce emissions in

improved delivery efficiency, and by reducing operational
energy use with the installation of solar panels.

Amazon Private Brands
We continuously work to decarbonize Amazon Private
Brands’ supply chain and product materials and set a
high bar for responsible sourcing. As of the end of 2024,
we had measured the carbon footprint of 75% of our
non-food related products. This exercise confirmed the
largest carbon abatement opportunities for Amazon
Private Brands guiding our decarbonization efforts
for 2025 and beyond. In 2024, we also used the Higg
Facility Environmental Module to assess our apparel
suppliers’ product manufacturing activities and identified
engagement opportunities with more carbon-intensive
suppliers, such as fabric mills.
We regularly evaluate Amazon Private Brands’
environmental and responsible sourcing standards, and, in
2024, we enhanced our lower-carbon material standards
for new products. We also regularly seek opportunities
to collaborate with our suppliers on developing more
sustainable materials. For example, we worked with a
home textiles supplier to recycle polyester scraps from its
production lines to reduce the use of virgin polyester in
Amazon Private Brands’ products. We also strive to reduce
packaging for Amazon Private Brands products, including
by collaborating with suppliers on packaging optimization,
and we prioritize the development of Amazon Private
Brands products that have certifications recognized by
our Climate Pledge Friendly program. As of the end of
2024, 29% of Amazon Private Brands product sales were
recognized by certifications in this program. In addition, we
publish a Formulated Products Restricted Substances List
and a Packaging Restricted Substance List outlining the
materials we seek to avoid in specific products. Amazon
enforces these restricted substances lists with our suppliers
individually and through industry groups.

Amazon Devices
We aim for each generation of Amazon devices to be more
carbon-efficient than the last. One way we do this is by
incorporating recycled materials in our products. By the
end of 2024, various components across Echo, Fire TV,
Fire tablets, and Kindle were made from a majority
of—or all—recycled materials. These included 58%
recycled plastic, 100% recycled yarn, 100% recycled
aluminum, and 90% recycled magnesium. In 2024, we
also launched 25 new devices and accessories with a
SCS Recycled Content or a Carbon Trust certification,
which are certifications recognized by our Climate Pledge
Friendly program.
While we do not source directly from mine sites and
smelters, we are committed to avoiding the use of
minerals that have fueled conflict. We aim to have
100% of tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold smelters and
refiners in our supply chain conform with a recognized
minerals certification program. In addition, we aim to use
more recycled materials when sourcing minerals for our
electronic products. In 2024, we introduced the new Kindle
Colorsoft Signature Edition e-reader with a battery made
from 100% recycled cobalt and the Echo Hub Smart Home
Control Panel with magnets made from 100% recycled
rare earth elements. We also engage our suppliers and
supply chain partners on responsible mineral sourcing
mechanisms and collaborate to advance industry-wide
progress. Learn more about our approach to avoiding
conflict minerals in our Conflict Minerals Report
We set a goal to invest in new renewable energy capacity
to match the electricity used by our customers’ Echo,
Fire TV and Ring devices by 2025. By 2022, we had
contracted enough renewable energy capacity to match
our 2025 projections. In 2024, when this capacity was
brought online, we matched the electricity used by active
Echo, Fire TV and Ring devices—a full year ahead of
our goal. By the end of 2024, over 71% of Echo devices
and Fire TVs featured Low Power Mode, compared to

Responsible Business Practices

67% in 2023. We continue to issue over-the-air updates
so that older devices can also use this feature. We also
strive to use best-in-class practices to make our products
more resilient and last longer, so they do not need to be
replaced as often.
In 2024, 89% of new devices and accessories featured
100% recyclable packaging in the U.S., now at 42 devices
in total, but down from 90% in 2023, due to the types
of devices released in 2024. Some products, large Fire
TVs for example, require non-recyclable packaging
components (e.g., expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam)
to meet shipping and storage product protection
requirements. We also introduced redesigned packaging
for Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV devices that replaces, on
average, 30% of the fiber content with recycled fiber, and
has 60% less ink compared to previous packaging. This
new packaging also reduces our reliance on virgin tree-based
and bleached fibers, resulting in an average of 98% wood
fiber-based materials from responsibly managed forests
or recycled sources used in packaging across our device
product lines.
We work with our suppliers to reduce waste throughout
our supply chain. In 2024, 62 supplier sites achieved UL
Solutions’ Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWTL) certification at
Silver level or better, up from 10 sites when we launched our
ZWTL program in 2021. 43 This includes all final assembly
sites and packaging sites worldwide for Echo, Kindle, Ring,
Fire tablets, Fire TV devices, cables, and adapters.
We publish carbon footprints and product
sustainability fact sheets assured by the Carbon Trust
for all latest Echo, eero, Ring, Fire TV, and Fire tablet
devices on our website to enhance transparency around
the sustainability of our devices. In 2024, we updated
these fact sheets to include carbon footprint comparisons
against previous-generation models. We also launched
our first carbon footprint fact sheet in the UK for our
latest Echo device. We plan to roll these fact sheets out in
more countries in 2025.

and access benefits through our A to Z app and website,
which 96% of employees visited each month in 2024. In
total, we invested $10.8 billion in employee benefits in 59
countries, a 7% increase over 2023.

Additionally, the Amazon Cancer Advocacy, Resources,
Education, and Support (CARES) program provides
high-touch, one-to-one support for employees and their
family members who have been diagnosed. In 2024,
CARES supported over 4,000 employees in 63 countries.

For regular full-time and reduced-time employees,
benefits start on their first day of employment and
include health care insurance coverage, up to 100% paid
prepartum and postpartum leave, ways to save for the
future, and health and well-being resources. 45 We also
offer valuable benefits to seasonal employees.

We prioritize comprehensive mental health support
through two key programs. Our Employee Assistance
Program (EAP) serves nearly 1.7 million employees, their
families, and household members across 62 countries,
offering up to six free counseling sessions per issue
annually and a globally accessible therapeutic app for daily
mental health support. It is available 24/7 in most major
world languages, 100% confidential, and free of charge.
Additionally, in 2024, we launched a custom mental health
network through Lyra Health for employees enrolled in
Amazon health plans. This service provides specialized
mental health services on average within two days.

Health and Well-Being Benefits
We look at our employees’ full range of health and
well-being needs and provide medical coverage, mental
health and wellness support, and life, disability, and other
types of insurance. Amazon health insurance covered
approximately 1.6 million employees and family members
globally in 2024.
We integrate whole person care into our approach to
promote health and wellness for enrolled members. In
the U.S., we offer integrated primary care clinics providing
affordable health care services, including primary
care, behavioral health, and physical therapy. We have
expanded access to 90-day prescriptions for chronic
non-specialty medications across our pharmacy network,
including Amazon Pharmacy, which offers same-day
delivery, automatic price comparisons, and automatic drug
discount card application at checkout. Additionally, all U.S.
Amazon employees have access to a free 24/7 Medical
Advice Line from their first day, regardless of medical plan
enrollment, allowing them to talk with a registered nurse
whenever and wherever they need medical advice.
Amazon continues to support initiatives to fight cancer.
To that end, members enrolled in a self-insured plan
who are 45 years or older may request a free at-home
colorectal cancer screening kit to increase early detection.

We design our EAP benefits globally as an essential
resource for employees and their families seeking daily
guidance or support. In 2024, we expanded our wellness
offerings by adding coaching in all countries outside the
U.S. (except Ireland) to help employees manage weight,
nutrition, physical activity, smoking/vaping cessation, and
stress reduction. 46 U.S. employees enrolled in a health
plan, along with their spouses and dependents ages
15 or older, can access Pelago, a digital clinic offering
personalized, confidential treatment for substance use.
Pelago’s physician-led program combines
medication-assisted treatments with health goal-tracking
tools, an on-demand library, and additional resources.
Separately, Amazon broadened access to evidencebased cognitive behavioral therapy and trauma-focused
counseling services in additional regions around the world.

Financial Benefits
Amazon offers a number of benefits that help employees
carve out a path to financial security. In 2024, we
expanded the financial assistance program we began

offering last year through Brightside Financial Care to all
50 U.S. states. Customer fulfillment and transportation
employees can use Brightside to reduce or consolidate
debt, and personal coaches can recommend customized
plans to improve financial health. The program provided
$27 million worth of financial solutions and resources
to hourly employees in 2024, up from nearly $14 million
in 2023. More than 52,000 employees engaged in this
program in 2024, an 82% year-over-year increase.
Our paycheck-linked savings program helps employees
prepare for unexpected expenses and achieve personal
financial goals through automatic payroll elections. In
2024, employees allocated $37 million in emergency
savings and over $5 million toward other financial goals
through this program.
In 2024, we launched a new home purchase benefit to
support employees, simplifying the process of obtaining a
mortgage. We also added a tax-advantaged 529 educational
savings benefit to assist employees in saving and investing
for their children’s qualified post-secondary education
expenses. We continued to support our employees with
charitable giving through our Donor-Advised Fund benefit,
which drove over $26 million in giving during the past year.
We also offer supplementary retirement benefits in 37
countries and provided nearly $1 billion in such benefits to
over 1 million U.S. employees in 2024.

Family-Building Benefits
All U.S. employees enrolled in our self-insured medical
plans—regardless of their gender, sexual orientation,
or relationship status—have access to family-building
benefits including in vitro fertilization, egg freezing,
genetic testing, access to fertility specialists, adoption
assistance and reimbursement, and more. In the U.S., we
offer up to 20 weeks of paid leave for birthing parents,
up to six weeks of paid parental leave for partners, and a
reduced schedule for up to eight weeks after the birth or
adoption of a child. Over 30,000 U.S. full-time and hourly

Amazon employees utilized these family-building benefits
in 2024. Employees in 55 other countries can access
fertility navigation services. In 2024, we also expanded
our contraception benefit for U.S. employees and
dependents, allowing them to receive a 12-month supply
of birth control pills.

Commuter Benefits
In 2024, we offered flexible commuter subsidies in 94%
of countries where our employees live or work, regardless
of how employees prefer to get to work—by car, public
transportation, or bicycle. In the U.S., employees can also
apply their subsidy toward vanpool, carpool, and rideshare.

Investing in Upskilling Programs
for Our Employees
We want Amazon employees to grow meaningful careers,
whether they stay with us or eventually work elsewhere.
We believe that Amazon is one of the best places for career
development because we are committed to skill building
no matter an employee’s aspirations. Upskilling is key to
our talent development approach, empowering employees
to build the skills they need to remain competitive, grow
their careers, and move into higher-paying roles. These
efforts also assist in building a strong pipeline to fill
current and future in-demand jobs, both at Amazon and
elsewhere. We announced our Upskilling Pledge in 2019,
and have used our allocated spend of $1.2 billion to invest
in nine U.S. programs to fund education and technical skills
training for Amazon employees. Since 2019, approximately
439,000 employees have participated in the U.S. and
710,000 participated globally.

we launched this offering in the U.S. in 2022.

Among our other upskilling programs , our Mechatronics
and Robotics Apprenticeship program has trained 4,930
people for careers as electromechanical technicians since
2019. Graduates of this program, which is registered
with the U.S. Department of Labor, make an average of
$21,500 per year more than the typical starting wage for
an entry-level fulfillment center role. In 2024, 100% of
program graduates have found employment in the field.

• 41 industry certifications for in-demand roles in
technology, health care, transportation, mechanical and
industrial systems, and business and administration. We
continue creating new pathways to in-demand roles for
our employees.
• English and local language learning globally and U.S.
high school completion and GED programs. Nearly
1,700 participating employees have now earned their
high school credential GEDs.
• Coaching to support employee career goals no matter
where they are in their journey. Approximately 35,500
employees in the U.S. participated through 2024.
Health care roles are in high demand, and Amazon’s
Career Choice is helping associates move into new careers
and fill vital positions through our pharmacy technician
career pathway. Launched to support both internal
Amazon hiring needs in Amazon Pharmacy as well as to
fill the growing health care needs in our communities,
this pathway creates meaningful career advancement for
our associates. In 2024, 93% of participants completed
the program, and 67% achieved certification.
Career Choice continues to evolve based on employee
feedback. For example, in 2024, we removed the 90-day
waiting period for new employees to enroll in the popular
English- and local-language classes. Employees wanted

Employee Engagement
and Communications
Amazon uses various communication channels to
maintain awareness of and responsiveness to changing
dynamics, questions, concerns, and ideas across our large
global workforce. This includes direct engagement, such
as all-Amazon meetings with general managers,
stand-up meetings with direct supervisors, and other
one-on-one meetings.
Amazon’s Ethics Line allows employees to voice concerns
and anonymously report violations of Amazon’s Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics . We provide other
communications channels as well for employees to
express concerns, share feedback, offer suggestions, and
ask questions. For example, MyVoice—Amazon’s primary
Voice of the Associate platform—provides a two-way
communication channel between our global associates
and their site leadership and is integrated within our
A to Z app for a user-friendly mobile experience. In 2024,
employees provided over 945,000 comments in MyVoice.

Employee Experience

Connections is our real-time, companywide feedback
mechanism, available in 62 countries and 29 languages.
Each day, employees receive Connections questions via
their computers, workstation devices, or hand scanners.
Connections improves the employee experience by
identifying obstacles to meaningful work, surfacing issues
before they become acute problems, and highlighting
strengths so they do not become missed opportunities.
In 2024, employees generated more than 1.7 million
Connections responses per day. Connections analyzes
and aggregates individual response data, sharing it with
managers at the team level to maintain confidentiality.
Managers can then take relevant actions for improvement
to build trust with their teams.
We also host Associate Roundtables, Forums, and Safety
Committees. Associate Roundtables offer employees a
meaningful opportunity to discuss issues, ask questions,
and get immediate feedback from their managers and site
leaders. Amazon hosts these meetings around the globe,
with their exact cadence varying by business line and site.
In Associate Forums, employees elected by their peers
meet directly with site management at regular intervals to
share ideas, concerns, information, and feedback on key
decisions that affect the site or the employee experience.
Topics may include working practices, shift schedules, and
employee well-being. At the end of 2024, we had 158
active Associate Forums.

We respect the rights to freedom of association and
collective bargaining as well as workers’ right to
join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful
organization of their own selection, without fear of
reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. Globally, Amazon
applies or is party to dozens of collective bargaining
agreements at national, regional, sectoral, and
enterprise levels. In 2022, we established a European
Works Council, which is composed of workers and
employer representatives and meets regularly to discuss
transnational company issues.

Associate Safety Committees provide an opportunity
to describe new safety initiatives and gather employee
feedback on relevant safety matters at various
sites globally.
Communication to our employees through safety training
is also foundational to safety excellence. All operations
employees receive safety training on their first day of
employment, and it covers a variety of topics such as
ownership of safety, incident reporting and investigation,
and stop work authority. Training continues with routine

Our Approach
With an organization of more than 10,000 safety
professionals dedicated to keeping over 1 million
operations employees safe every day, nothing is more
important than ensuring our people’s safety. We know
that every person is someone’s mother, father, sibling,
child, or best friend, and that’s why we’ve set an ambitious
goal to become the benchmark of safety excellence across
all industries in which we operate.
In 2024, we focused on expanding and executing an
effective strategy to improve safety across our global
operations, and it led to meaningful, measurable progress.
While we’re encouraged by our continued progress, we
know there’s more work to do, and we’re committed to
further improvement as we work toward our goal.

Our Progress
Evaluating Our Safety Performance
We have made meaningful progress on global safety
since 2019. Our Recordable Incident Rate (RIR), which
encompasses any work-related injury requiring more
than basic first-aid treatment, has shown measurable
improvement. Over the past five years, we’ve seen a 34%
reduction in RIR, with a 6% decrease year over year. Our
Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR), which accounts for the

Biodiversity

Human Rights

most serious injuries requiring time away from work, has
improved by 65% over the last five years, with
a 13% reduction year over year.
Learn more about how Amazon’s safety performance
improved year over year

Safety in the United States
In the U.S., we report our operations data to the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
under various industry codes that reflect the kind of work
we do across our network. The majority of our data is
reported under the General Warehousing and Storage and
Courier and Express Delivery Services codes. As seen on
the following page, we continued making year-over-year
progress across all categories, building on our meaningful
progress over the past five years.
In the U.S. General Warehousing and Storage industry, our
RIR improved by 27% over the past five years and 5% year
over year. 47 Within the same sector, LTIR showed a 79%
improvement over the past five years and a 9%
year-over-year reduction.
In the U.S. Courier and Express Delivery Services industry,
we achieved a 50% improvement in our RIR over the past
five years and a 16% reduction year over year. 48 Our LTIR
in this sector improved by 74% over the past five years,
with a 25% reduction year over year.
These graphs illustrate our progress year over year and
how we stack up against industry averages calculated by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS calculates
these averages using data from selected employers
and releases them each November, so the most recent
averages available are for 2023.
We’re continuing to make steady and meaningful
progress. That said, we’ve never aspired to be average
because when it comes to safety there is no such thing
as “good enough.” We want to be the safest company in

the industries in which we operate, so we’re consistently
innovating and investing in safety measures. In 2025
alone, we’ve allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to
invest in technologies, resources, training, and programs
to further our safety efforts.

Understanding Our Operations
and Workforce
Globally, our operations network has more than doubled
in size since 2019—to more than 1 million operations
employees across more than 2,500 sites around the world.
Alongside that growth, we’ve worked hard to further build
and evolve our culture of safety.
We know that we can’t get safety right without our
employees’ feedback. We’ve created several ways for
employees to give us feedback on how to improve, but
one tool we’re especially proud of is Dragonfly. Available
on employees’ devices or at on-site kiosks, Dragonfly
enables employees to provide suggestions from the palm
of their hand and notifies their site managers, who then
take appropriate action as needed. In 2024, over 130,000
employees used Dragonfly to provide suggestions. Some
recommendations include small changes like repositioning
a package scanner so it isn’t accidentally knocked over,
while others involve more complex safety measures like
adding laser motion sensors to alert forklift drivers when
people are nearby. Whether simple or sophisticated, these
improvements make a big difference at scale in creating a
safer, simpler employee experience.

Auditing and Inspecting Our Sites
We consider both employee feedback and data when
we’re identifying opportunities for improvement and
developing proactive safety measures. This approach
allows us to not only evaluate overall injury rates
but also analyze the types and frequencies of injuries

injury in any workplace—across all industries—is what’s
called a musculoskeletal disorder (MSD), more commonly
known as a strain or sprain. Over the past five years, the
rate of MSD recordable incident rates at Amazon has
improved 32%, but they still make up about 57% of all
recordable injuries at Amazon. To continue reducing MSD
injuries, we’ve devoted considerable resources to improve
ergonomic conditions as part of our ongoing investments
in safety improvements.

Since 2019, we’ve invested more than $2 billion in our
safety efforts, including new technologies and programs
to protect our employees. A key part of this investment is
our focus on reducing MSD injuries. Across our operations
network, we are retrofitting our sites with adjustable
height workstations and carts, and implementing our
proprietary, award-winning ErgoPick technology to ensure
employees pick packages within their ergonomic power
zone—the area between the shoulder and mid-thigh.
We’ve also increased the use of robotics in our warehouses
to handle repetitive tasks and heavy lifting that can lead
to MSDs, supporting a safer workplace. Robot systems
like Robin and Cardinal help sort, lift, and place packages.
They handle repetitive tasks so our employees can work
more comfortably. Additionally, one of our newest
robotics systems, Sequoia, transports inventory directly
to employees’ workstations at an ergonomically friendly
height, eliminating the need for them to reach above
their heads or squat. These are just a few examples of
the innovations we’ve created to provide a safer work
environment for our employees so they can focus on more
engaging tasks.
In addition to investing in new technology, we also plan for
things like extreme weather that can impact our employees’
and partners’ safety, and our policies and procedures for
addressing the heat and cold are robust and often exceed
industry standards. For example, Amazon-branded vans

come equipped with air conditioning, which is above
industry standards, and if it isn’t working, the vehicle
is taken out of service immediately. We also prioritize
understanding emerging safety trends to help create
safer working environments. As an example, while we
hope to never have to use it, we stocked naloxone, an
over-the-counter opioid overdose reversal medication,
in our U.S. and Canada fulfillment centers to proactively
strengthen our emergency response procedures.
We’re also proud that last year, we received eight different
safety awards from respected organizations including
the National Safety Council, Verdantix, and the Network
of Employers for Traffic Safety. These awards recognized
safety innovations like our proprietary ErgoPick, our
AI-enabled sensor technology that helps reduce risks
when loading trailers, our cutting-edge employee training
programs, and our world-class safety professionals.

Working Safely with Our
Operations Partners
Within our operations network, we work with partners
around the world to deliver packages to our customers
safely and efficiently. For example, we work with small
business owners called Delivery Service Partners (DSPs)
and independent contractors called Amazon Flex delivery
partners to deliver packages to customers’ doorsteps.
We also work with independent, long-haul trucking
companies to move products across our network. We’re
committed to helping our partners keep their employees
safe by offering them access to industry-leading safety
technologies, resources, and training.

Delivery Network
To help keep drivers and communities safe, we’re
constantly designing and implementing new safety
improvements to our branded vans used for last mile
delivery. For example, all Amazon-branded vans are

Biodiversity

Human Rights

Responsible Supply Chain

equipped with camera-based technology that helps
monitor safe driving behaviors. The system provides
real-time feedback on key safety behaviors including
speed control, maintaining focus, proper seat belt use,
and adherence to road signs. If unsafe behaviors are
detected, drivers receive coaching notifications during
their delivery stop, and if the behaviors do not improve,
the driver’s employer—the DSPs—are notified so they
can further coach the driver. We’re also introducing
live safety cues (audible and visual) for drivers that
proactively inform them of low-clearance bridges, railroad
crossings, unpaved roads, and areas where they need to
have additional awareness, such as school zones. We’ve
enhanced the Amazon Flex app for delivery partners
using their own vehicles with safety-focused features.
These include alerts for potential roadway hazards and
the presence of pets at delivery locations, as well as a new
chat feature that lets delivery partners notify customers
when they’re approaching.

Ultimately, we recognize that our scale demands exceptional
road safety—a commitment recently acknowledged by the
Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile’s (FIA) highest
rating. It’s why we’re relentlessly creating and iterating
new safety improvements for our partners to help keep
them and the communities where they operate safe.

Last year, we also began rolling out our latest invention:
Vision-Assisted Package Retrieval (VAPR) technology.
VAPR reduces time drivers spend looking for packages
in their van. Based on early tests, results yielded a 67%
reduction in perceived physical effort, and we’re excited
to continue this rollout.

Freight Network
For long-haul transportation, we’ve made investments
in safety through our Relay technology, which carriers
use to book and execute work for Amazon. This includes
implementing stringent driver ID verification for every load
to ensure we know exactly who is handling our shipments.
We’ve also enhanced our safety guidance and trip planning
features that provide drivers with route-specific weather
forecasts, in-app alerts, and satellite imagery for safe
navigation. We also improved our fleet of more than
50,000 branded trailers by adding flashing auxiliary lamps
and reflective tape to ensure trailers are more visible to
help drivers on the road maintain a safe distance.

Amazon enhances long-haul safety with our Relay
app, adding driver verification, route planning,
and weather alerts.

Our Approach
Amazon is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive
company that helps us provide the best range of products
and services for our vast and varied customer base. We build
pathways for employees, partners, and customers from all
backgrounds to work, collaborate, and shop with us.
Over the last several years, we’ve proven that this work is
most effective when it is built into our business and into
the way we work from the start, rather than through a
“bolted-on” program. Our focus is on integrating inclusive
practices into core business processes and fostering a
truly inclusive culture. Whether it’s through the way
we hire, develop talent, design our products, or serve
our communities, we will continue driving our “built-in”
strategy, creating scalable programs and technologies that
serve our globally diverse customers.

Our Progress
Our Employees
We believe that technology provides us with the
best path to reach more than 1.5 million full- and
part-time employees. We use a comprehensive,
data-driven approach to evaluate employee programs
based on their demonstrated impact.

Biodiversity

Human Rights

Responsible Supply Chain

Sustainable Products

Our efforts are constantly evolving as we continue to
measure outcomes and learn how we can further improve.
Since evolving to our “built-in” approach in 2022,
we’ve made significant strides in identifying programs
that deliver meaningful impact for our employees.
In 2024, we continued to invest in the programs
that demonstrated measurable results and had the
potential to scale. For example, we expanded Amazon
Huddles—micro-discussions that help build an inclusive
culture—to reach tens of thousands of employees
globally, seamlessly integrating it into everything from
new-employee onboarding to ongoing team meetings.
Employees have responded positively to these 15- to
30-minute conversations on topics such as culture,
well-being, and personal and professional growth. When
an employee participates in Amazon Huddles, we see
durable improvements in job satisfaction, managerial
skills, and team connectivity.
The following are just a few additional examples of where
we’ve built inclusive systems that are working better,
at scale, for people across our ecosystem. They help us
create an environment where people have the resources
they need to do their best work.
• Promotions for our frontline employees. We learned
that our promotion process for frontline operation roles
was primarily being sourced from referrals by their
managers. While that approach had good intentions, the
focus on local site presence resulted in varying levels of
access and opportunity across locations. To minimize
the potential for bias, we built a tool called Fluid to
surface opportunities to all employees who meet the

• Hiring. Like most companies, we have a referral
program where existing Amazonians can recommend
someone who may be qualified for an open role. We
have a recruiting team that will search the market for
the best talent for individual roles. And we have also
built a tool that works alongside those efforts to ensure
we find talent from a wide range of backgrounds and
life experiences. It sorts through the qualifications of
tens of millions of applicants, surfacing the best talent
based on eligibility requirements. This means that
anyone, from any background, can be fairly evaluated if
they’re interested in joining our team.
• Benefits. As we looked at who used our benefits, we saw
that many eligible people weren’t using them. We dug
into the reasons and realized that a root cause was a
lack of awareness. Those who knew about the benefits
used them, so we focused on raising awareness among
all populations to ensure that when someone needs
help—no matter who they are or where they are in the
company—they know how to get it.
• Upskilling. Career Choice has helped nearly 244,000
employees pursue education with prepaid tuition,
flexible schedules, and on-site classes. Similarly, our
Apprenticeship programs have created hundreds
of paths into technical roles since 2017—in cloud
computing, software development, robotics, and
mechanical maintenance—by focusing on potential
over prerequisites.

• Together at Amazon. We launched Together at Amazon
in August 2024 to bring together participants in our
employee-led groups, including affinity groups and
informal employee networks. Self-led by Amazonians,
these groups are open to all employees and offer
community and support. Together at Amazon invites

friends more enjoyable. We also expanded Fire TV’s
hearing aid compatibility beyond Cochlear and Starkey,
adding WS Audiology (WSA) in 2024. On Prime Video,
the new Dialogue Boost feature lets viewers increase
the volume of dialogue relative to background music
and effects to create a more comfortable and accessible
viewing experience. In 2024, we also expanded the
number of languages and audio-described titles across
U.S. streaming services.
For the Kindle app on iOS, Android, and the Fire tablet,
we added Assistive Reader to support customers who are
blind or have low vision. This feature allows customers
the flexibility to listen to their books—and read along
with real-time highlighting. To improve access to product
information, we rolled out new tactile-marked
QR codes on inbox documentation for Kindles, Echo
devices, and most Fire TVs. These QR codes link to
comprehensive accessibility documents and quick-start
guides, helping customers who are blind or have low
vision access online content.
Amazon has relied on a major project collaboration tool
to meet the needs of a wide range of assistive technology
users at our company, including those who use screen
readers, screen magnifiers, or alternative navigation. In
2024, we leveraged our global reach to extend use of this
tool to more than 100,000 third-party sellers, making it a
requirement as part of their enterprise licenses.
In January 2025, we also launched enhanced product
summary functionality to make online shopping more
accessible for screen reader users and those relying on
keyboard-only navigation. This feature identifies and
presents critical product information in a streamlined
interface. As a result, blind- or low-vision shoppers can
find the most relevant information about the products
they’re browsing and more quickly make informed
purchase decisions.

Inclusive Access in TV, Film, and Music
Amazon continues to invest in strategic partnerships and
programs to support the development of talent across TV,
film, and music. In 2024, Amazon MGM Studios remained
the primary sponsor of the Latino Film Institute’s Youth
Cinema Project Alumni Program, which connects students
to industry mentoring and assistance with college
applications. Our collaboration with the Cherokee Nation
provided full-ride scholarships to Cherokee Film Institute’s
inaugural 2025 class. In the UK, our Prime Video Pathway
partnership with the National Film and Television School
expanded career opportunities in TV and film nationwide.
We also sponsored the 2025 ReelAbilities Film Festival,
the largest showcase for stories from the disability
community, as well as the 2025 Easterseals Disability Film
Challenge. In the music sector, Amazon Music renewed its
collaboration with the Recording Academy’s Black Music
Collective through the Your Future Is Now scholarship
program. Additionally, we supported the MusiCares
Humans of Hip-Hop program, a multi-year initiative
that provides access to under-represented communities
for financial, medical, and mental health services, and
partnered with the Association of Independent Music and
Women in CTRL to launch the Amplify apprenticeship for
women and non-binary talent in the UK music industry.

Reliable Access to Broadband
Project Kuiper is among our most ambitious initiatives
to expand access to reliable broadband. Through a
constellation of 3,200 satellites in low Earth orbit, we will
bring fast, affordable service to unserved and underserved
communities around the world. This effort will benefit
a wide range of customers, including schools, hospitals,
businesses, government agencies, and others that operate
in places without reliable connectivity or that need more
flexible, resilient communications capabilities. We began
deploying our satellite constellation in early 2025, and
expect to roll out service later in the year.

Our Communities
With our size, speed, and innovative culture, Amazon’s
philanthropic and volunteering initiatives are driving
change on a global scale. We are active in neighborhoods
around the world, creating inclusive experiences that offer
more opportunities to succeed. For example, education
initiatives around Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics (STEM); engagement with institutions that
support people from all backgrounds; and direct exposure
to work at Amazon through our JumpStart program, all
help create paths to employment across our communities.
Among our latest initiatives, In This Together (ITT)
helps us respond to community needs through targeted
economic and technological advancement opportunities.
ITT provides access to a curated list of Amazon resources
for civic organizations, professional associations, and
educational institutions globally. It covers a few key
areas, including career and hiring opportunities, supplier
development, business ownership pathways, seller
education and resources, training and certifications,
discount programs, and accessibility solutions.
Amazon products also help make our communities

Affordable Housing
We believe everyone should have access to housing they
can afford. However, the possibility of homeownership
remains out of reach for many in the U.S., especially
for low-income families. In January 2021, we launched
the Housing Equity Fund with the goal of increasing
access to affordable homes. When the Fund started,
we committed $2 billion to help create and preserve
20,000 affordable homes across three of our hometown
communities—Washington State’s Puget Sound region;
the Arlington, Virginia/National Capital region; and
Nashville, Tennessee. We exceeded this original goal
two years early by providing $2.2 billion to create and
preserve more than 21,000 affordable homes. In 2024,
we announced an expanded commitment of $1.4 billion
to create and preserve an additional 14,000 homes,
bringing Amazon’s total commitment to $3.6 billion to
help create or preserve 35,000 affordable homes in these
three communities.

Addressing Food Security
We use our logistics, technology, and infrastructure to
innovate on behalf of people facing food insecurity.
This includes mobilizing our transportation network to
provide bulk food transport, as well as free meal deliveries
to households in need. In addition, we are increasing
collaboration with food rescue and redistribution

Health Resources
In July 2024, AWS concluded the AWS Health Equity
Initiative (HEI) , a $60 million commitment to use cloud
technology to address disparities in global health. Over three
years, HEI supported 403 organizations across 39 countries,
reaching every continent except Antarctica, reflecting
the growing span of health customers and their focus on
utilizing technology to address access to health care.

Access to Education and Skills-Building
We develop and advance programs that empower learners
of all ages and skill levels with digital education and
technical skills to prepare more people for jobs of the future.
This includes giving school-age students opportunities to
prepare for future education and careers in technology.
One example is our childhood-to-career computer science
program, Amazon Future Engineer , which reached more
than 7.8 million students in 2024 across grade levels, up
from 3.9 million in 2023. Another example is AWS Think

educators participated in 93 of these spaces. AWS also
offers the AWS Machine Learning University educator
enablement program , which trains employees on the
theory and practical application of machine learning (ML)
and AI.
As of the end of 2024, we delivered free cloud computing
skills training to 31 million learners—surpassing our goal
to help 29 million people by 2025. Similarly, through
AWS’s free AI skills training initiative, AI Ready , we
reached our target of training 2 million learners globally
with free AI skills, achieving both milestones ahead of our
2025 commitment. AWS offers more than 135 free and
low-cost courses and learning resources on AI, ML, and
generative AI. In addition, AWS InCommunities ,
Amazon’s community efforts in data center locations,
focuses on STEM education, local skills development,
sustainability, and hyper-local social impact. In 2024, AWS
launched 11 InCommunities funds and allocated nearly
$2 million globally in hyper-local funding.
For those just starting their careers or looking to break
into a new field, the AWS AI and ML Scholarship
program , in collaboration with Udacity, awarded 2,500
scholarships in 2024 to support students globally to learn
foundational skills to prepare for careers in technology.
The AWS Skills to Jobs Tech Alliance , an educational
and skills training program, has now connected 37,000
learners to employers.
We also support organizations that build digital learning
solutions for underserved learners. For example, in 2024,
AWS launched the AWS Education Equity Initiative ,

to support innovative learning solutions such as coding
curriculums, AI assistants, and more.

AI for Social Good

Giving Back through Volunteering Efforts

Amazon is committed to unlocking the potential of AI for
social good. AWS’s AI for Changemakers (AI4C) program
provides nonprofits and social enterprises with cloud
credits, technical training, and mentorship to build and
scale AI-based solutions that address global challenges.
As part of AI4C, AWS launched the Now Go Build CTO
Fellowship, a mentorship program for senior technical
leaders. AWS also supports the United Nations-led digital
platform, AI for Good , investing $800,000 with 10
organizations and projects to identify practical AI solutions
that advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Amazon also contributes to building healthy communities
through employee volunteering. During our 2024 Global
Month of Volunteering , Amazon employees from over
50 countries participated in more than 5,000 volunteering
events. Throughout the year, over 250,000 participants
volunteered with 7,000 nonprofit and community
organizations across over 55 countries. In addition, our pro
bono program enabled more than 1,400 legal and public
policy professionals to provide 16,200 hours of free legal
support globally in 2024.

Supporting Disaster Relief
and Response Efforts
Whether in times of immediate crisis or when long-term
support is needed, we respond by showing up in communities.
Through Amazon Disaster Relief, we leverage our
technology and global logistics network to provide fast,
effective aid for communities affected by natural disasters.
Our 15 global Disaster Relief Hubs across the U.S., Europe,
Asia, and Australia are facilities stocked with relief items
including shelter materials, hygiene supplies, and medical
equipment. In 2024, Amazon provided support during 39
disasters across 19 countries—including the devastating
hurricanes in the Southeast U.S. and flooding across
central Europe and Southern Spain. Amazon donated
$10 million to support the Southern California wildfires
in January 2025, including donating 550,000 items from
its Wildfire Disaster Relief Hub, as well as providing
AWS cloud technology, including drone support, to help
emergency responders quickly assess and react to the
wildfires’ conditions. We used our logistics network to
donate and deliver 4.1 million relief items to nonprofit
partners. We also deployed our AWS cloud technology to
help local governments and organizations stay connected,
providing nearly $2 million in AWS credits to 41 customers
affected by eight natural disasters.

We mobilized our European Disaster Relief Hub and
volunteer employees to aid those impacted by flooding
in southeastern Spain.

Shareholder Engagement
We believe that effective corporate governance includes
year-round engagement with our shareholders. Our
shareholder engagement team includes employees whose
full-time, year-round responsibilities include engaging
with our investors, communicating with management and
directly with our Board members to inform them on topics
discussed and feedback received in the course of their
engagement meetings, and coordinating and promoting
the effectiveness of direct shareholder engagement
meetings that our directors participate in.
From the beginning of 2024 through April 10, 2025, when
we filed our 2025 Proxy Statement, we engaged with 70
of our 100 largest unaffiliated shareholders, as well as with
numerous other shareholders. Our lead independent
director, the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee, or the Chair of the Leadership
Development and Compensation Committee participated
in meetings with shareholders owning more than 25% of
our stock, including one-on-one or small group meetings
with most of our 20 largest shareholders.
Our direct engagement with shareholders helps us better
understand our shareholders’ priorities, perspectives,
and areas of concern, while giving us an opportunity
to elaborate on our many initiatives and practices and
to address the extent to which various aspects of these
matters are (or are not) significant given the scope and
nature of our operations and our existing practices. We
take insights from this feedback into consideration and
regularly share them with our Board as we review and
evolve our practices and disclosures.

our product and service offerings; and in our ability to

Amazon has policies and practices in place to help
enforce adherence to local, state, federal, and laws of
other countries. Our Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics , associated policies, procedures, training, and
communications outline our expectations of employees.
The Business Conduct and Ethics program is led by the
Vice President for Business Conduct and Ethics, who
reports to the Senior Vice President, Chief Global Affairs
& Legal Officer. Our Business Conduct and Ethics program
includes an annual risk assessment and compliance
goal-setting process that is informed by client interviews
and leadership of each department, a whistleblower
hotline, centralized investigation and reporting of
violations, a due diligence program designed to detect
potential compliance issues with third parties before
engaging in business transactions with those third parties,
a conflict of interest program and disclosure mechanism,
a gifts, entertainment, and travel program, and a wide
variety of online and in-person training about compliancerelated topics and the company’s compliance policies.

Maintaining an Ethical Culture
Amazon has zero tolerance for bribery and/or corruption
in any form for any of our businesses. Our anti-corruption
compliance program—part of a centralized global
compliance program—is led by the Vice President for
Business Conduct and Ethics and the Global Business
Conduct and Ethics team with regional oversight. It is
informed by our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and
Anti-Bribery Policy, which include outright prohibitions on
bribery of any kind. We reinforce these policies through
regular online and live trainings with employees.

designed to identify, monitor, and evaluate risks including
fraud, misappropriation of assets, corruption, and
financial reporting integrity. Control functions like finance,
procurement, and internal audit collaborate with the Business
Conduct and Ethics team to detect and prevent corruption.
Our gift and entertainment reporting mechanism requires
employees to disclose and seek approval for qualifying gifts
or services received from third parties or given to government
officials. We also provide a mechanism for employees to
disclose potential conflicts of interest and receive guidance
on necessary remediation.
Amazon actively encourages our employees to report any
issues or concerns without fear of reprisal, intimidation,
or harassment and provides various secure and accessible
channels to do so. Any employee can go directly to
Human Resources, the Legal Department, or any manager
with questions about the application of the Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics or how to approach difficult
workplace situations.
Employees can also voice concerns, anonymously report
potential violations of Amazon’s Code of Business Conduct
and Ethics, and ask questions about potentially unethical
conduct through Amazon’s Ethics Line. The Ethics Line
is currently available in 65 countries in 165 languages.
Reports received through the Ethics Line are routed to the
appropriate teams with the knowledge and experience to
address the employee’s particular issue.
We prohibit retaliation and take all allegations seriously.
Our Business Conduct and Ethics team records, and where
appropriate investigates (or directs others to investigate)
and reports alleged violations of the Code of Conduct to the

in director-level positions or above, and on investigation
progress and findings. The Leadership Development and
Compensation Committee receives detailed quarterly
updates on any allegations of unlawful harassment and
discrimination against employees in vice-president-level
positions or above, or employees externally investigated
on our behalf.
Amazon maintains an appeals process for our employees.
Across the U.S. and Canada, eligible employees can submit
an appeal through an online service to challenge certain
disciplinary actions. The applicable manager reviews the
claim to verify policies have been correctly applied. Where
this is not the case, appropriate remediation can then
be taken.

employee feedback

Training
Integrity and ethics begin with our leaders and Board.
Amazon’s Board receives training on the Code of Conduct,
anti-corruption, and competition. All employees (including
part-time and seasonal employees) receive Code of
Conduct training during onboarding, with regular refresher
training thereafter. Employees may receive additional
anti-corruption and anti-bribery training based on their
roles, as well as competition training and training on
discrimination and harassment.

Advancing Anti-Corruption Efforts with
Governments and Industry Partners
In 2024, we strengthened our engagement externally
to drive progress and cooperation. We are a part of
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development’s Galvanizing the Private Sector program ,
which includes its Anti-Corruption Leaders Hub (ACLH), a
working group of public officials, civil society groups,
and private sector compliance leaders. ACLH is an
important forum for advancing efforts toward digitizing
compliance information and transaction data and
expanding local partner vetting programs—which are
among Amazon’s priorities.

Supplier Development and Impact
Amazon works with thousands of suppliers globally,
ranging from small local businesses to large multinational
corporations. One of the mechanisms for ensuring we
continue to build a robust global supply base is through
Supplier Development and Impact (SDI) , which provides
qualified and competitive Disadvantaged-Owned
Businesses (DOBs) a fair opportunity to compete within
our supply chain.
Amazon’s SDI Tier 1 spend—direct payments to DOBs
for goods and services—increased from $4.3 billion in
2023 to $9.7 billion in 2024. We increased purchases with
existing suppliers in our supply chain and also identified
new companies, bringing the total number of qualified,
competitive DOBs to more than 500. In 2024, we made
direct payments to DOBs in seven countries.
Amazon SDI creates impact through both direct spend
with DOBs and through our Tier 2 program, where
Tier 1 suppliers are encouraged to include qualified and
competitive DOBs in their sourcing activities. In 2024,
243 Tier 1 suppliers shared that more than $2.1 billion in
Tier 2 spend was achieved. 52 Through improved processes
and technologies, our spend with DOBs strengthened

Policy and Advocacy
Amazon’s public policy work serves our customers by
encouraging long-term legal and regulatory preparedness
for our existing and future businesses. We engage with
policymakers on a wide range of issues and also partner
with multilateral organizations, industry associations,
coalitions, and other stakeholders to advance our
positions . For example, we advocate in support of public
policy that aligns with our commitment to reach net-zero
carbon emissions across our global supply chain by 2040,
including carbon-free energy, and on policies aimed at
reducing packaging materials.
We publish an annual political engagement statement
detailing our U.S. lobbying activities and disclosing
spending on ballot initiatives and public organizations, as
well as with state and local representatives. In the EU, we
disclose our activities in the EU Transparency Register and
national registries, where required.
Our Senior Vice President, Chief Global Affairs & Legal
Officer, who oversees our global public policy organizations,
and the Audit Committee of the Board annually review
this U.S. Political Engagement Policy and Statement. They

Responsible Artificial
Intelligence (AI)
From reducing packaging and food waste to powering
fulfillment and data center operations more efficiently,
Amazon has been innovating with AI and ML for decades.
As one of the world’s leading developers and deployers
of AI tools and services, Amazon supports fostering the
safe, responsible, and effective use of AI technology.
We are dedicated to driving innovation on behalf of our
customers while also establishing and implementing
the necessary safeguards to protect our customers,
end users, and everyday consumers. Amazon remains
committed to continued collaboration with policymakers,
industry, researchers, and the AI community to advance
the responsible use of AI.
In February 2024, Amazon joined the U.S. Artificial
Intelligence Safety Institute (AISI) Consortium, established
by NIST, and in May 2024, joined the Frontier Model Forum
to advance AI safety and security through best practices
development. This partnership focuses on AI model
evaluations and information sharing between industry,
academia, government, and civil society. In November
2024, AWS became the first major cloud provider to
receive ISO/IEC 42001 certification for its AI services,
including Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Q Business, Amazon
Textract, and Amazon Transcribe. ISO/IEC 42001 is the
international standard establishing requirements for
responsible AI system development.

Topics
Assessment

Disclaimer and Forward-Looking Statements

Our Process
Our assessment process was guided by leading
reporting frameworks, including the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI), and consisted of the
following phases:

Identify Topics

Identifying Our Priorities
Amazon’s business spans many industries, including but
not limited to e-commerce, cloud computing, consumer
goods, entertainment, and logistics. We operate globally
and employ more than 1.5 million full- and part-time
employees worldwide. This broad scope means that we
must consider how a wide range of topics relate to
our business.
In 2024, we conducted a comprehensive topic assessment
to inform the contents of this report. We identified the
topics that we believe are most relevant to our business
and stakeholders globally as of 2024, most of which are
consistent with past analyses and with the topics covered
in our past reports.

Through stakeholder research and industry analysis, we
identified topics that could be relevant to Amazon and
our stakeholders. We started with an long list of topics,
which we consolidated into a smaller subset of more
comprehensive topic groupings.

Our Priority Topics
The following list represents our priority topics, many of
which are examined in dedicated sections of this report.
We view many of these topics as interconnected and
recognize that making progress in one area can often help
solve for challenges in another. The following topics are
listed in alphabetical order.
• Biodiversity
• Business Ethics
• Communities
• Corporate Governance
• Customer Experience and Satisfaction

Engage with Stakeholders
We mapped key internal and external stakeholder
groups across our value chain. We gathered their input
through direct interviews, surveys, and analysis of written
materials that reflect stakeholder perspectives.

We also recognize there are topics beyond these priorities
that may be relevant to certain aspects of our business
or to certain stakeholders. Amazon has programs and
policies in place covering many other topics. While we
may reference aspects of additional topics throughout
this report, information about other topics can generally
be found on our corporate website and/or our
sustainability website .

Monitoring Our Priorities
We will continue to monitor the relevance of these topics
and engage with stakeholders on an ongoing basis. We
will conduct updates or additional assessments as we see
changes to our priorities over time.

• Data Privacy and Security
• Emerging Technology
• Employee Attraction, Retention, and Development
• Inclusive Experiences

Assess Inputs
We analyzed stakeholder inputs using a structured scoring
framework. We evaluated each input based on the topics
discussed by the source and the level of detail provided.
For each source of input, we assigned a score for all topics
discussed or referenced.

• Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Energy, and Climate Change
• Human Rights
• Labor Rights
• Materials, Waste, and Circularity
• Policy and Advocacy

Prioritize Topics
We computed the total scores for each topic based on all
stakeholder inputs and ranked topics by their total score.
Higher-scoring topics ranked among our higher priorities.
We shared these findings with key internal stakeholders
and leaders.

• Product Safety and Quality
• Responsible Marketing and Advertising
• Water
• Workplace Health and Safety

Supply chains focus on sourcing materials and delivering goods to
customers. Value chains include upstream supply chain as well as
downstream delivery to customers, customer use of products, and
end-of-life of products.
Carbon-free energy includes existing renewable energy technologies,
such as wind and solar farms and on-site rooftop solar systems, as well
as other sources that generate carbon-free energy, such as nuclear
reactors, hydroelectric, and geothermal. Our investments also include
site energy contracts and green tariffs with local utilities that result in
new wind and solar projects being added to the grid.
As detailed in our Renewable Energy Methodology , to calculate the
percentage of renewable energy matched by the electricity consumed by
our global operations, we evaluate both the amount of renewable energy
from Amazon’s projects and the renewable energy in the grid. This total
renewable energy is then compared to Amazon’s total energy use.
In our 2022 and 2023 Reports, we stated this goal had been met
with contracted energy capacity. In 2024, the contracted energy
became operational.
Electric delivery vans include Rivian and vans from other electric vehicle
manufacturers.
Electric delivery vehicles include four-wheel (electric delivery vans),
three-wheel, two-wheel, and e-mopeds.
Amazon’s carbon footprint is reported in metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (MTCO2e), where each metric ton of CO2 emissions represents
the same global warming potential as one metric ton of another
greenhouse gas. Learn more in our Carbon Methodology .

8.

Carbon intensity measures emissions growth against the growth of the
business. Carbon intensity at Amazon is measured in grams of CO2e per
dollar of gross merchandise sales (g CO2e/$GMS).

9.

We regularly refine our carbon measurement approach to improve
accuracy. In 2024, we updated our emissions data sources, which led us
to recalculate our 2022 and 2023 figures. While we did not apply these
new methods to 2021 and earlier data, year-over-year comparisons
remain possible, though the methodology differs between 2024 and
2019 carbon intensity calculations.
